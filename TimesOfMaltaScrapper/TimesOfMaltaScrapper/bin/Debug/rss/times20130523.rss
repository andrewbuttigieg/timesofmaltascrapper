								Gianluca Bezzina, also dubbed as 'Doctor Feelgood', has returned to work in the surgical wards of Mater Dei Hospital after an exhilarating two weeks in Malm?? representing Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest.
He told Kim Dalli that his Eurovision experience has provided him with the perfect ice-breaker when treating patients.
He now looked forward to seeing his singing and medical careers develop and mature although he would focus especially on the latter.
Gianluca placed eighth in last Saturday's festival, Malta's best result since 2005.				]]></description>

								Phyllis Muscat has been appointed chairwoman of a coordinating board for culture projects.
The board is being set up to take stock of the current cultural situation, foster and facilitate coordination between entities working in the field and serve as an incubator for new major cultural initiatives and capital projects.
The board, whose other members are tenor Joseph Calleja, Ruth Bianco, Brian Schembri and Giorgina Portelli, will work towards fully utilising the potential of culture as a catalyst of economic and social restructuring.
It will advice and submit proposals to the Government on all aspects related to this industry, while strengthening existing collaboration and establishing new cooperation with local and international stakeholders.
It will create and manage a cultural roadmap containing strategic milestones for the country in the area. The roadmap will integrate various cultural initiatives while addressing gaps in the cultural scene for an increased valorisation of Malta???s cultural assets as a source of identity and economic growth.
The government said the appointments and the board itself reiterated its commitment to put artists at the heart of the primary decisions...				]]></description>

								Heritage NGO Din l-Art ??elwa insisted today that Ordnance Street and the entrance to Valletta are unsuitable for the Monti open market, particularly because of the potential spill over across the new Parliament building up to Victory Square.
"This idea lacks vision for the area and may be the result of a hurried decision taken without sufficient reflection on the devaluation it is going to bring to the investment made to upgrade City Gate. It is ironic that while the Government plans to relocate and tidy up the unsightly kiosks and stalls just outside the entrance to Valletta, on the other hand it may now be proposing to place market stalls just within the city walls thus restoring dignity to one side and taking it away from the other," the NGO said.
"While acknowledging that the current market site at Merchants Street may have its drawbacks and that other solutions may be considered, the entrance to Valletta is wholly unsuitable for this open-air market," the society said.				]]></description>

								British authorities believe that two men accused of hacking a soldier to death on a London street in revenge for wars in Muslim countries are British of Nigerian descent, a source close to the investigation said.
Local media named one of the two suspects as British-born, 28-year-old Londoner Michael Adebolajo and said police raided homes of relatives in the city and near the town of Lincoln. Both men involved in Wednesday's attack appeared to have converted to Islam from Christian backgrounds, media said.
Adebolajo and the other man, who may have been born abroad, are both in custody in hospitals after being shot by police.
As security experts highlighted the risk to Western cities of "lone wolf" attacks - similar to last month's Boston Marathon bombing - by local people radicalised over the Internet, Prime Minister David Cameron held an emergency meeting of his intelligence chiefs to assess the response to what he called a "terrorist" attack; it was the first deadly strike in mainland Britain since local Islamists killed dozens in London in 2005.
"We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms," Cameron said outside his Downing Street office.

								An Egyptian immigrant who escaped custody from Malta eight years ago but returned a few months ago to regularise his position was this morning given a one year jail term suspended for two.
Police Inspector Edel Mary Camilleri told Magistrate Carol Peralta that Gergis Nadi Saad Fadil, 31, had escaped from the Safi detention centre.
She said that Mr Fadil was a Coptic Christian asylum seeker who feared for his safety should he be sent back to Egypt.
Since his return to Malta, Mr Fadil has been living with a priest in Mosta.
The inspector told the magistrate that Mr Fadil was to be kept in custody because according to law he was an irregular migrant and had to spend an amount of time in detention.				]]></description>

								Hawkers who set up their stalls every day in Merchants Street, Valletta, cannot wait to move to Ordinance Street, saying business is at its worst in their present location.
They said that like other workers and self-employed, they had families to sustain.
The hawkers told Times of Malta yesterday that the Government had finally listened to their pleas to move towards the centre of the capital.
Economy Minister Chris Cardona told Parliament earlier this week that discussions were underway with the hawkers over their relocation.
Although plans have not yet been finalised, an understanding had already been struck between the hawkers and the Labour Party prior to the March 8 general election for the relocation of the flea market.
Contacted yesterday, a spokesman for the ministry would only confirm that discussions were being held, saying further details ???will be announced in due course???.
Hawker Godwin Azzopardi, who has been in the trade for almost four decades, said he had never seen business to be as bad as after they were shifted to the bottom of Merchants Street.
???We were moved as far away as possible from the centre and placed on the periphery where people barely come. Can you...				]]></description>

								The court decision to suspend the two-year jail term given to a man who shot and buried alive Star, the dog, does not dampen the message of intolerance towards animal cruelty, anthropologist Mark-Anthony Falzon believes.

???I don???t think this judgment sent out a message to go ahead and kill and bury a dog because the public outcry was so huge, as was the vilification of the person,??? Prof. Falzon said.
On Monday, an appeal court reduced the punishment handed down to Alfred Vella, the 44-year-old farmer who admitted shooting and burying Star on May 19, 2011.
The two-year jail term given to Mr Vella was suspended for two years and a ???10,000 fine was cut to ???9,000.
This was done after the court took into account the fact that Mr Vella had filed an early guilty plea and had a clean criminal record.
Animal Welfare Directorate head Joseph John Vella agreed with Prof. Falzon???s view that the Star story had such a huge impact it would not be wiped out by the appeal judgment.
???The Star story has helped to raise animal awareness and this, in itself, contributed to raising public awareness and improving the attitude towards animals,??? he said.
Star, a mixed-breed female, was discovered buried...				]]></description>

								The government is looking into schemes, including better childcare facilities, to encourage more women to join the army, Home Affairs Minister Manuel Mallia said this morning.
Speaking during the passing out parade of 78 recruits, the minister said only four per cent of soldiers were women, five of whom were among this morning???s recruits.
The recruits also included shooter William Chetcuti, who formed part of the soldier athlete scheme, which allows recruit athletes to practice their sport for 20 hours each week and attend soldier training for the other 20 hours.
The recruits, who have been through 19 weeks of training, also included 12 Gozitans.
Dr Mallia said the government was thinking about extending night patrol operations in Gozo to allow more Gozitan soldiers to serve in Gozo.
He said that at the beginning of this legislature, ???700,000 were invested in a night surveillance system and ???52,000 in fire-fighting and communication equipment at the new hangar at Malta International Airport.
The minister said the government was analysing the prospects of further utilising EU funds to improve army equipment and facilities.				]]></description>

								The Nationalist Party in a statement has criticised the government's decision to appoint Ronnie Pellegrini as a director of the Malta Freeport Corporation.
It said such appointments fly in the face of promises that appointments would be made on the basis of merit.
The party said persons from the prime minister's circle were being appointed instead of competent people.
Mr Pellegrini, the PN said, was known for his links with the GWU, with former minister Lorry Sant, and with former PL general secretary Jason Micallef. But it questioned what credentials he had for this position.				]]></description>

								An 80-year-old Japanese mountain climber who has had four heart surgeries reached the top of Mount Everest yoday becoming the oldest person to conquer the world's highest mountain.

Yuichiro Miura, who took the standard southeast ridge route pioneered by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay 60 years ago, reached the top of the 8,848 metre (29,028 feet) mountain at about 9:00 a.m.. He was accompanied by three other Japanese, including his son, and six Nepali sherpas.
"This is the greatest feeling in the world," he told family members and supporters gathered in Tokyo, speaking from the summit by satellite phone.
"I never thought I'd get to the summit of Everest at the age of 80. It was the best feeling to get here, but now I'm completely exhausted."
Miura, who first climbed Everest in 2003 and repeated the feat five years later, takes the oldest climber record from Nepal's Min Bahadur Sherchan, who reached the summit at the age of 76 in 2008.
"The record is not so important to me," Miura told Reuters in April, before setting off for Everest. "It is important to get to the top."
Miura spent the night at 8,500 metres (27,887 ft) at the Balcony in the so-called death zone before...				]]></description>
