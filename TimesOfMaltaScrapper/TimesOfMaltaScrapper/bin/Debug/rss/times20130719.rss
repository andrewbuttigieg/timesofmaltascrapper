								Auxiliary bishop Charles Scicluna is accompanying Maltese young people who are taking part in Youth Day celebrations in Brazil.
The official celebrations, which are being led by Pope Francis, start on Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro.
Bishop Scicluna is visiting a parish in Rolandia, in Parana, where Maltese young people are carrying out voluntary work in the community.
The parish, dedicated to St Joseph, is administered by Gozitan priest Fr Jose Agius.
This evening, the Maltese delegation will head to Jundiai where it will meet Maltese bishop Vincent Costa.				]]></description>

								The credit agency Standard and Poor has affirmed the long- and short-term sovereign credit ratings on Malta's rating at 'BBB+/A-2' - outlook stable.
The government welcomed the decision.
In its commentary, S&P said the new government had a strong electoral mandate that favoured reforms.
"However, we believe tight public finances and a high debt burden will constrain the government's flexibility, particularly as we forecast growth will remain below pre-crisis levels.
"We are affirming our long- and short-term sovereign credit ratings on Malta at 'BBB+/A-2'.
The stable outlook balances our view of improving prospects for economic reform against Malta's recurrent fiscal and external deficits.
The transfer and convertibility assessment remains at 'AAA'.
S&P said the ratings were supported by its view of Malta's relatively strong institutional and governance effectiveness, and its prosperous economy.
However, a sizable government debt burden and external imbalances constrained the ratings.
"We note that the new Labour Party government is progressing with the details of a wide-ranging reform agenda. It is tackling long-standing issues such as energy sector reform, and health care and...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Egypt's interim president pledged to protect his country against those who sought chaos and violence in the aftermath of a popularly-backed military coup, promising justice and reconciliation for all.
Adly Mansour gave his first address to the nation ahead of planned protests today by supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood.
Egypt's military, already worried by post-coup violence that has killed more than 60 people, issued a stern warning about causing unrest during the scheduled protests by both the Brotherhood and Morsi opponents.
In his eight-minute, pre-recorded message broadcast on state television, Mr Mansour said Egypt was going through a "decisive period" in its history where some wanted to drag the country towards the "unknown" and cause chaos.
"They want this period to be an introduction to violence and blood, and we want it to establish for the concept of protecting lives and human rights," Mr Mansour said.
He did not name those who he said "are pushing the nation towards the abyss thinking they are doing good" - but clearly was referring to pro-Morsi protesters. He said those who protested against Mr Morsi starting on June 30 were "the...				]]></description>

								Health Minister Godfrey Farrugia said he was aware John Dalli???s own daughter was working as his personal assistant in his new role as Mater Dei Hospital reform chief.
Dr Farrugia said Mr Dalli had every right to choose whoever he liked for such a position.
The former European Commissioner appointed his daughter, Louisa, shortly after it was announced that he would head a reform team within the admin??istration of the country???s main hospital, which has been plagued with chronic mismanagement since opening its doors in 2008.
Asked about this yesterday, Dr Farrugia said: ???Every adviser has a right to choose his PA. He trusts this person and, therefore, yes (it???s acceptable).???
He said her contract had not been drawn up yet and neither had that of Mr Dalli, who, Dr Farrugia said was ???working on a voluntary basis???.
Asked whether the government would make public the remuneration packages, Dr Farrugia said: ???As always???.
The reform was a challenge which Mr Dalli set himself when he was appointed Social Policy Minister in 2008, with responsibilities that included health.
In 2009, he pledged a ???revolution??? at the hospital to tackle the growing problem of waiting lists for operations.

								The following are the top stories in the national and international press today.
All newspapers today report about the murders of drug trafficker Mario Camilleri and his son Mario (Jr) who were reported missing yesterday. The two men were well known to the police, having got into trouble with the law a number of times. They had not yet been found by the time the newspapers went to print.
Quoting a geological rock assessment unveiled by the Environment Ministry yesterday, Times of Malta says Gozo???s Azure Window was not facing imminent collapse but further erosion was ???inevitable???.
The Malta Independent says the European Commission has confirmed it will help Malta with the repatriation of failed asylum seekers. In another story it says that 150 police officers who were facing disciplinary proceedings were given an amnesty by the new Police Commissioner.
In-Nazzjon says that three ministers - Edward Scicluna, Manuel Mallia and Karmenu Vella opted not to declare their earnings last year. In another story it says that 224 transfers were given in the police force in the past three months.

								EXPLOSIVE CHUTNEY
A woman has told of her shock after a jar of home-made rhubarb chutney caused her fridge to explode.
Margaret Goodwin, 66, of Henley was in bed asleep when she was woken by the noise of the fridge door being blown off its hinges and fired across the kitchen of her flat.
The explosion has been blamed on the chutney in the glass jar fermenting and causing a build-up of gas.
WATER WALLY
A 40-year-old American has been rescued after attempting to sail from Dorset to Ireland in a 6ft inflatable dinghy, Coastguard said.
The man had two paddles with him - one of which was being used as a mast accompanied by a plastic sheet as a sail - and the other was acting as the rudder, with limited amount of food and drink for the journey.
Portland Coastguard received a call from a range safety craft reporting concern for the man, who was approximately 2.7 nautical miles south of Durdle Door.

			<description><![CDATA[
								Former CIA Milan station chief Robert Seldon Lady, convicted in Italy of kidnapping an Egyptian Muslim cleric, has been arrested in Panama, Italian and Panamanian officials said.
Italy's top court last year upheld a guilty verdict against Seldon Lady for the kidnapping of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr.
Seldon Lady was originally sentenced in the first trial of its kind against "rendition" flights practiced by the administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Panamanian police official said Seldon Lady had been arrested by Panama's border authorities and handed over to Interpol.
It was not clear where Seldon Lady would be taken. Italy and Panama have no bilateral extradition treaty, according to documents on the Italian Justice Ministry's website.
Earlier on Thursday, Italian judicial sources also said that Seldon Lady had been captured in Panama.
The CIA declined to comment.
Osama Nasr was snatched from a Milan street in 2003 and flown to Egypt for interrogation, where he says he was tortured for seven months. The imam, also known as Abu Omar, was a resident of Italy at the time of the abduction.
Prosecutors alleged the CIA flew the imam...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								President Barack Obama has renominated Timothy Broas, a criminal defence lawyer and campaign donor, as ambassador to the Netherlands, a year after Broas withdrew from consideration following his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol.
After his first nomination, Broas was charged for driving while under the influence of alcohol, speeding and resisting arrest in his suburban Maryland neighborhood.
"While the case was pending, he thought it was inappropriate for his name to be considered," his lawyer, Paul Kemp, told Reuters.
Prosecutors later dropped the more serious charges and Broas pleaded guilty to a lesser traffic offence of driving while impaired, and was given probation before judgment - meaning he was not formally convicted of the offence.
"It was that minimal a charge," Kemp said.
The White House declined comment.
His nomination will require Senate confirmation.
Broas, a partner at Winston & Strawn in Washington, bundled more than $500,000 in donations for Obama's 2012 election campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
At his Senate confirmation hearing last year, just days before his arrest, Broas explained how he had spent 30 years defending...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Hundreds of people protested in Democratic Republic of Congo???s eastern city of Goma yesterday against President Joseph Kabila, accusing him of incompetence in efforts to neutralise rebels who have long plagued the region.
Heavy fighting erupted between the army and the M23 rebel group on Sunday 12 kilometres northeast of Goma, ending several weeks of relative calm and reviving memories of an attack in November when the Tutsi-led insurgents briefly seized the city of one million people.
After four days of clashes, when the army pushed the rebels several kilometres further from the city, the front line was quiet yesterday.
Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd from the centre of Goma where protesters blocked roads and displayed a sign saying ???Kabila Must Go???. Shops and businesses were shuttered.
Even after the rebels were repelled, ???there were rumours circulating this morning that the government was going to replace senior army officers,??? said local journalist Charles Lwanga. ???The population staged peaceful demonstrations, trying to block the airport and the port.???
Lambert Mende, spokesman for the Kinshasa government, said it had no plans to replace the military command in...				]]></description>

								Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to five years in jail for theft yesterday, an unexpectedly tough punishment which supporters said proved President Vladimir Putin was a dictator ruling by repression.
Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner who led the biggest protests against Putin since he took power in 2000, hugged his wife Yulia and his mother, shook his father???s hand and then passed them his watch before being led him away in handcuffs.
???Shame! Disgrace!??? protesters chanted outside the court in Kirov, 900 km northeast of Moscow. Some supporters wept and others could barely hide their shock and anger.
State prosecutors had asked the court to jail Navalny for six years on charges of organising a scheme to steal at least 16 million roubles (???376,625) from a timber firm when he was advising the Kirov region governor in 2009.
But even a five-year sentence means he will not be able to run in the next presidential election in 2018 or for Moscow mayor in September as he had planned. Some political analysts had expected the court to hand down a suspended sentence, to keep Navalny out of prison but rule out any political challenge.
The US and EU expressed concern...				]]></description>

								Egypt???s Muslim Brotherhood yesterday called for mass protests for today in its campaign to reverse the army???s overthrow of the elected Islamist President, but it also gave a first sign of willingness to negotiate with its opponents.
The rallies aim to show Mohamed Morsi???s supporters are not ready to accept the new military-backed government. However, a Brotherhood official also said on Thursday that the movement had proposed a framework for talks mediated by the EU.
Sworn into office on Tuesday, the Cabinet of interim premier Hazem el-Beblawy busied itself with tackling the nation???s many woes, buying foreign wheat to replenish stocks and banking $3 billion (???2.29 billion) in badly needed aid from the United Arab Emirates.
Still stunned by the July 3 toppling of Morsi, his Muslim Brotherhood, and allies grouped in what it calls the National Alliance for Legitimacy, urged nationwide rallies today, predicting millions would take to the streets.
???To every free Egyptian man and woman: Come out against the bloody military coup,??? the alliance said in a statement.

			<description><![CDATA[
								Johnny Rotten may not like it but he is starting to become Johnny Icon.
The 57-year-old former frontman of the anarchic 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols is to receive an award for his contribution to music from the music rights organisation BMI, although he angrily rejected previous honours.
Singer-songwriter John Lydon, who went by the name Johnny Rotten as he belted out songs like Pretty Vacant and Anarchy in the UK, will be presented with BMI???s Icon Award at a gala in London on October 15.
Lydon, with his trademark orange hair, and the Pistols are credited with launching punk rock in Britain and inspiring scores of other musicians with their expletive-ridden, anti-establishment rage.
???John Lydon is a true icon whose influence on music, fashion and art has been felt around the world,??? Del Bryant, BMI President and CEO, said yesterday in a statement.
Lydon was not immediately available to comment on the award but news of the honour was posted on his website and tweeted by his current band, Public Image Ltd, suggesting he had accepted.
In fact Lydon does appear to have mellowed over the years.
In 2004 he appeared in the reality TV show I???m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! in which...				]]></description>

								Italy???s centre-left Democratic Party agreed yesterday to back its centre-right coalition partner???s interior minister in a no confidence vote, heading off a potential crisis for Prime Minister Enrico Letta???s fra-gile government.
Party secretary Gugliemo Epifani said PD lawmakers would vote against the motion called by opposition parties demanding minister Angelino Alfano resign over the rushed deportation of the family of a dissident Kazakh oligarch in May.
???Tomorrow we will vote ???No??? to the no-confidence motion with a declaration explaining our position,??? Epifani told reporters after a party meeting before today???s vote.
The decision eased fears of a split in the PD after a group of centre-left senators pushed for the party to join the opposition in voting against Alfano, despite warnings from the centre right that the government, which also includes a small centrist party, would fall if he was forced out.
The vote is expected in the early afternoon after a debate in the Senate in which Letta is expected to speak in defence of Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right People of Freedom party (PDL), who holds the title of deputy prime minister.
Earlier, President Giorgio Napolitano...				]]></description>

								The Indian government announced yesterday it would set up an inquiry into the quality of food given to school pupils in a nationwide free meal scheme after at least 23 children died in one of the deadliest outbreaks of mass poisoning in years.
Within minutes of eating a meal of rice and potato curry in the eastern state of Bihar on Tuesday, the children began to fall ill, a cook at the school at the centre of the outbreak said from her hospital bed.
The children, aged four to 12, died after vomiting and convulsing from agonising stomach cramps, officials and relatives said. Death came so quickly for some that they died in their parents??? arms while being taken to hospital.
Dozens of other children are being treated for food poisoning in hospital.
Police said they were searching for the headmistress of the school in Gandaman village in Bihar, one of India???s most impoverished states, who has disappeared, along with her family. The school provided free meals under the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, the world???s largest school feeding programme involving 120 million children.
Police said it was not possible to conclusively say what caused the poisoning, but the focus of the investigation was on...				]]></description>

								Japan has ordered geological survey ships to prepare for possible deployment to the East China Sea after it detected Chinese drilling near the disputed maritime border, a source with direct knowledge of the order said yesterday.
A plan by Chinese state-run oil firms to dramatically expand gas drilling in the disputed East China Sea, which threatens to further damage ties between Asia???s two biggest economies, was first reported by Reuters on Wednesday.
In a possible sign of brinkmanship, Japanese survey ships, if deployed, would operate ???right up to the median line???, which is the disputed maritime boundary with China, said the senior Japanese source who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Tension over the East China Sea has escalated this year, with China and Japan scrambling fighter jets and ordering patrol ships to shadow each other, raising fear that a miscalculation could lead to a broader clash.
The Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) has been ordered to put both its survey ships on standby and to prepare to deploy without any foreign members of staff on board, said the source.
A spokesman at JOGMEC referred inquiries to the...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								British regulators investigating the fire on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner identified the plane???s emergency locator beacon as a likely source of the blaze and said yesterday it should be switched off.
Boeing said the beacon could be removed in about an hour from its newest model plane, which was grounded for more than three months earlier this year due to a battery issue that regulators said was unrelated to the fire on an Ethiopian Airlines jet in London a week ago.
The US Federal Aviation Administration regulations do not require the transmitter, but some other nations do, the plane maker said in a statement backing the British report.
A European regulatory official said the jets could fly with the locator beacons temporarily de-activated, despite regulations mandating them in most commercial situations.
Analysts cautioned that the British report still left open the question of how the fire actually started.
???This is not really what you call a conclusive answer,??? said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant with the Teal Group. ???There???s nothing about this finding that indicates a lack of safety with the plane, but on the other hand there???s no conclusive proof that a system unrelated...				]]></description>

								A couple who found a newborn baby boy abandoned on their doorstep in a quiet suburb have described their shock at the discovery.
The boy, who weighs just 5lbs 8oz, was found wrapped in a thin blanket and placed in a canvas shopping bag at the door of a home in a quiet suburban neighbourhood of Worcester at around 4.15am yesterday.
Health officials and the police are now making strident efforts to trace the youngster???s mother over fears for her well-being, and have appealed directly for her to come forward.
The youngster, who is in good health, is now in the care of the children???s department at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital where nurses have named him Joseph.
Patti Paine, head of midwifery at the hospital, said the baby was ???a lovely little boy??? and was ???doing very well???. She said NHS records had not revealed any expectant mothers who were ???missing??? from their lists, adding she could not rule out the chances the mother may have concealed the pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Jon Hunt, of Lower Wick, Worcester, has been talking of the moment he and his wife Adrienne discovered there was a baby lying in a Woolworth???s shopping bag on their doorstep.
He believes whoever left the child there...				]]></description>

								With quiet satisfaction, France???s Socialist Government has watched Angela Merkel strike a softer stance on Europe in recent months as she prepares for Germany???s election.
What???s more, Paris believes the poll might just nudge the conservative Chancellor yet further from the hardline fiscal austerity policies she has embodied for much of the eurozone???s debt crisis.
With two months to go before the September 22 election, Fran??ois Hollande???s Government rates Merkel???s chances of securing a third term at ???85, even 90 per cent???, a senior aide said. More strikingly, it is comfortable with that outcome.
Just a year ago, Merkel contemplated letting debt-stressed Greece be jettisoned from the eurozone, while the newly-elected Hollande pondered leading a revolt of southern states to counter a feared German hegemony over Europe. Both stepped back from confrontation.
Hollande saw it was bad for French debt yields for France to be aligned with troubled states such as Greece or Italy; and Merkel feared her rising unpopularity outside Germany was a political liability, and was spooked by the huge potential cost to Berlin if a Greek exit led to a eurozone break-up.
In the 50th anniversary year of...				]]></description>
