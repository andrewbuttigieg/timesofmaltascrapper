								Maritime lawyer Ann Fenech has submitted her nomination for the post of president of the Nationalist Party executive.
Dr Fenech, who was only elected for the first time to the party???s executive last Saturday, has never been involved in any of the party structures officially before and had been pushed to run for the post of leader to replace Lawrence Gonzi.
She confirmed when contacted yesterday that she had submitted her nomination but would not be drawn into saying what she was expected to change in the party.
???It would be rather presumptuous of me to say what I???m going to change or what I???d like to change. The party has to do that and it has to be a team effort. It first has to come to terms with what happened and map out a way forward,??? she said.
Dr Fenech, managing partner of Fenech and Fenech Advocates and heads its marine litigation department, said it was a phase of her life in which she wanted to get involved in politics.
???It???s all a learning curve. I am sure there is a lot of good that must be retained. However, there are also issues which caused grief to people and I think the party needs to address this.???

Dr Fenech is compiling, along with a number of other people, a...				]]></description>

								A European survey has found that one third of deliveries in Malta is by?? Caesarean section, one of the highest in Europe. Malta also has a high rate of multiple births caused by Artificial reproductive techniques.
The wide-ranging report, based on 2010 data, says that Neonatal mortality rates ranged from 1.2 per 1000 live births in Iceland to 4.5 in Malta and 5.5 in Romania. After excluding births and deaths before 24 weeks of gestation, these rates fell, ranging from 0.8 per 1000 live births in Iceland to 4.3 in Romania. Infant mortality rates ranged from 2.3 per 1000 live births in Iceland and Finland to 5.5 in Malta, 5.7 in Latvia, and 9.8 in Romania.
Countries where terminations of pregnancy are not legal or access is very restricted may have higher fetal, neonatal, and infant mortality rates due to deaths attributed to lethal congenital anomalies.
Low weight babies
The percentage of low birthweight babies is geographically patterned, partially reflecting differences in population birth weight, and was stable over time in most countries, the report says.
The percentage of live births with a birth weight under 2500g varied from under 4 to over 9% in Europe. Countries from...				]]></description>

								The following are the top stories in the Maltese and overseas press.
The Times of Malta reports how the EU has insisted that Malta brings its deficit to acceptable level.
The Malta Independent says OLAF director-general Giovanni Kessler has invited critics to take any human rights breach claims to court.
In-Nazzjon says the government has to act within four months to bring down the deficit.?? It also reports more worker transfers within the Social Policy Ministry.
l-orizzont says a Maltese diplomat who was seized for a day in Libya in November, was ignored by the Nationalist government and remains jobless.
The overseas press
The eurozone will remain in recession in 2013, with the estimated GDP falling 0.6 percent and unemployment at 12.1 percent. Euronews quotes the OECD's Economic Outlook report saying this marks an increase of almost a percentage point compared to the previous year. In 2014, the OECD added, the eurozone economy should register a growth of 1.1 percent, even though the unemployment rate is destined to continue rising, reaching 12.3 percent.

								Leah Xuereb, the four-year-old who had life-saving treatment in Texas last year, is still undergoing chemotherapy in Malta, but has gained some normality.
???We have to travel to Malta for treatment or tests every day but, compared to what she has been through, Leah is now doing normal things that little girls do,??? her mother, Zhana, said at Rainbow Ward in Mater Dei Hospital yesterday.
???She rides her white bike, which she requested for Christmas, everyday and plays with her brother, Owen, and her new pet kitten, Tiger, all the time.???
Dressed in pink from head to toenails, the little girl bounced and rolled on her bed as the family waited for her dose of blood platelets, which she receives after chemotherapy.
In October, Leah won the nation???s heart when her parents made a plea through Times of Malta to fund her life-saving treatment for a rare form of cancer in a specialised Texas hospital.
At three, Leah had already spent half her life in hospital in Malta and in London.
The ???245,000 treatment in the US was funded by the Government and Leah managed to fulfil their wish to return to Malta just a few days before Christmas.
But the family was in for some bad news on New Year???s Eve...				]]></description>

								A baby rescued from a sewage pipe in China yesterday is recovering well, state media reported. 
The infant was abandoned in?? Zhejiang province's Jinhua city.
Unable to remove the 2.3 kilogram baby safely, firefighters brought the child to a hospital, where doctors carefully cut away the pipe.
The infant is in healthy condition, the doctors said, aside from scrapes to its head, arms and legs. 
Some reports said the baby's mother had claimed that she had given birth over the toilet bowl and the baby dropped accidentally.
China witnesses frequent reports of parents abandoning babies, often shortly after birth.				]]></description>

								The new Sars-like respiratory illness which has killed half of the people who have been infected with it is a "threat to the entire world", the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned.
Experts raised concerns that the disease is "emerging faster than our understanding".
The WHO says that since September last year there have been 44 laboratory confirmed cases across eight countries which have resulted in 22 deaths, including two people in the UK, but reports suggest that the figure could be higher.
Earlier this week, WHO's director general said that the novel virus, which has been called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus - or MERS-CoV, is her "greatest concern".
Addressing the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Dr Margaret Chan said: "Looking at the overall global situation, my greatest concern right now is the novel coronavirus.
"We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat.
"Any new disease that is emerging faster than our understanding is never under control.
"These are alarm bells and we must respond. The novel coronavirus is not a problem that any single affected country can keep to itself or manage all by...				]]></description>

								A computer malware variant is using Malta Police Force and Malta Police Association logos, the police warned.
They said in a statement that infected computer systems display a warning message claiming that the user???s computer had been ???suspended on the grounds of unauthorised cyber activity??? and that a fine has to be paid for the computer to be unblocked.
The computer may seize and documents may no longer be accessible. In almost all cases, paying the ransom does not restore the computer to its original state, the police warned.
They said that no law enforcement agency, including the police, collected fines in this manner.
???Such computer messages claiming to be from the Malta Police Force are fraudulent. Users targeted by police ransomware should not pay any money,??? the police said.
They said that anyone deceived into paying the ransom money should lodge a police report providing as much information as possible ??? including a screenshot of the ransom message presented, payment information, details of the activity being undertaken on the computer when the ransom message appeared as well as the date and time when this happened.

								The government this afternoon reacted to the European Commission's decision to place Malta under an Excessive Deficit Procedure by reiterating its commitment to get the deficit down below 3% by the end of this year.
The government said it welcomed the Commission's decision to not impose additional measures on the country's budget.
"This shows that the European Commission is confident in the new Government's plan, which is a positive sign for the future of the Maltese economy."
It said it is committed to ending 2013 with a deficit below the 3% threshold despite the Commission's decision to allow Malta the freedom to do so by the end of 2014.
"The Government is committed to meeting these targets, while also carefully addressing inefficiencies and introducing incentives aimed at boosting the country's revenue."
It was also noted that in its country specific recommendations, the Commission had removed any reference to changes to the cost of living adjustment mechanism.
"This is thanks to the strong defence mounted by the Maltese Government in this regard," the government said.

								The European Commission in its recommendations to Malta under the excessive deficit procedure said this afternoon that the country needs to reform the pension system to curb the projected increase in expenditure, including by accelerating the increase in the statutory retirement age, by introducing a link between the statutory retirement age and life expectancy and by encouraging private pension savings. ??
But Malta in its National Reform Programme, also published by the EU today said that the gradual increase in retirement age adopted in the 2006 Pension Reform remains valid. 
???Thus the parametric changes to the First Pension introduced in 2006 are deemed to have fulfilled their role as they braked what was an accelerated degeneration of the average pension replacement rate. Therefore, pending the current ongoing discussions taking place at national level on further pension reforms, we do not think that there is any particular urgency in further accelerating the progressive increase in the retirement age as suggested the first part of the recommendation.???

								Advertising agency MPS Ltd has been ordered to pay Transport Malta almost half a million euros in terms of a contract for the organisation and management of display advertisements on route buses.
The authority told the court that, in 1995, it had issued a call for tenders for the organisation and management of display of advertisements on route buses.
MPS had tendered for this contract, which it was awarded in September 1995. The contract provided for the payments due by MPS and the authority said that when it filed its court case, in 1999, MPS owed it Lm211,650 (???493,046.82).
MPS denied TM's claims and said it had submitted for the tender on the basis that advertisements could be carried on both sides of the buses.
However, only 100 of the 508 buses that existed at the time could carry such double advertisements. Many bus owners did not co-operate with MPS and eventually only 112 buses actually carried advertisements.
But the court found that MPS had entered into a contract with TM and that the terms of the contract had to be observed.				]]></description>

								The Maltese lyre, a musical instrument which only features in 18th century lithographs of Malta, will be launched at this year???s G??anafest, the Mediterranean folk festival which is held annually in June at the Argotti Botanical Gardens.
Joining the ranks of Maltese instruments such as the ??aqq, ??ummara and flejguta, it will be the first time that the Maltese lyre or lira has been heard in centuries.
In 2010, Malta???s ambassador to Tunisia Vicki Ann Cremona, invited Ruben Zahra ??? artistic director of G??anafest and leader of the Nafra folk ensemble - to conduct research in Tunisia with the support of the Cultural Diplomacy Fund - Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
This research at the Ennajma Ezzahra - Centre for Arab and Mediterranean Music in Sidi Bou Said led to tracing the roots of the Maltese instrument in the Byzantine tradition with an offshoot of the same instrument in Calabria.
Ettore Castagna, an Italian ethno-musicologist, musician and expert of the lira collaborated with Mr Zahra on the research and reconstruction of the Maltese lira. The reconstruction of the instrument was entrusted to Pietro Forlani, a master luthier from Calabria.

			<description><![CDATA[
								<p><img src="http://292fc373eb1b8428f75b-7f75e5eb51943043279413a54aaa858a.r38.cf3.rackcdn.com/7c79c42629179bb2ed70b35e47c5c1411774764608-1369829416-51a5f028-360x251.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>
								The European Commission today recommended that Malta be placed under an Excessive Deficit Procedure. It also called for reforms in pensions and healthcare and sustainable public finances.
The Commission recommends to the European Council that Malta should address its excessive deficit situation by 2014. Specifically, Malta should reach a headline deficit target of 3.4% of GDP for 2013 and 2.7% of GDP in 2014, which is consistent with an annual improvement of the structural balance of 0.7% of GDP in 2013, and 0.7% of GDP in 2014.
This adjustment path would allow bringing the deficit below the 3% of GDP reference value by 2014 while at the same time ensuring that the debt ratio will approach the 60%-of-GDP reference value at a satisfactory pace.
In a statement issued in Brussels, the Commission said:
"Malta faces important entrenched challenges that affect the sustainability of its public finances and its potential growth, and it was one of the countries identified by the Commission as experiencing macroeconomic imbalances, pertaining in particular to the financial sector and public finances.

			<description><![CDATA[
								Syria's main rebel group has urged the EU to supply weapons to rebels fighting president Bashar Assad's forces and and help them overthrow his regime.
The call by the Syrian National Coalition followed EU's decision earlier this week to let the Syrian arms embargo expire, paving way for individual countries in the 27-member union to send weapons to Assad's outgunned opponents.
However, the EU decision may have little impact on Syria's two-year-old conflict, since no single European country is expected to send lethal weapons to the rebels soon.
The Western-backed Syrian opposition coalition urged the EU to back the arms flow and promptly send "specialised weaponry to repel the fierce attacks waged against unarmed civilians" by Assad's regime, its allies in Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group and Iranian backers.
"The Coalition recognizes that this decision is part of many serious efforts by the EU to support the Syrian people throughout the hardships in the uprisings," it said. "However, despite the importance of this decision, the words must be solidified by action."

								A man spent 15 years not knowing he had a pencil stuck in his head following a childhood accident.
Doctors in Aachen, Germany said the 24-year-old sought help in 2011 after suffering for years from headaches, constant colds and worsening vision in one eye. A scan showed that a 4-inch pencil was lodged from his sinus to his pharynx and had injured his right eye socket.
The unnamed man said he did not know how the pencil got there but recalled that he once fell badly as a child.
The German doctors removed the pencil and said the man has recovered.				]]></description>

								The GWU said today that a new summer roster for drivers, announced by Arriva, is unacceptable and should be withdrawn to avoid industrial action.
It also said that a conciliation meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow between the bus operator, the union and the Director of employment and industrial relations in a bid to resolve the issue.?? 
The union condemned Arriva for issuing the roster without any consultations and said that what the company was proposing was inhumane.
Drivers who contacted timesofmalta.com also complained that they are being asked to drive for many hours, well beyond the statutory daily eight hours.				]]></description>
