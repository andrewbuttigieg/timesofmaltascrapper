			<description><![CDATA[
								Burma's president has pardoned at least 70 more political prisoners, just days after promising to free all who remain jailed by the end of the year.
The release of political detainees in Burma has been a key concern of the United States and other Western nations.
Around 200 were believed to be behind bars before the announcement by Ye Aung, a member of the government's political prisoner scrutiny committee.
He said at least 70 were released from various prisons today.
Activists have accused President Thein Sein's government of only freeing a few political prisoners in small batches, and usually for public relations purposes.				]]></description>

								Thousands of euro are being spent unnecessarily at Mater Dei Hospital on scans for patients suffering from rhinosinusitis since the nasal condition can often be diagnosed through its symptoms, according to a study.
Researchers Stephan Grech, Richard McKearney and Herman Borg-Xuereb looked into the cost to the health system from the use of X-rays and CT scans in managing rhinosinusitis ??? the inflammation of the nasal passages and sinus cavities.
Symptoms include a blocked nose, nasal discharge and facial pain.
The study, published in the Malta Medical Journal, found that in 2009 almost ???104,000 were spent at the hospital on plain radiographs, or X-rays, that cost ???77 each, and CT scans, that cost ???350 each.
???A proportion of this amount may have been spent unnecessarily. Judicious use of imaging requests while following clinical guidelines is required to save money and minimise patient exposure to ionising radiation,??? the study concludes.
It points out that CT scans expose patients to harmful radiation that are equivalent to that emitted by 55 chest X-rays.

The researchers looked at the scans carried out at Mater Dei Hospital throughout a year: 205 CT scans and 113 plain...				]]></description>

Mr Degabriele was shot dead at close range in broad daylight just outside Sammy???s Bar, near the Enemalta Customer Care office in Marsa. His assailant was waiting for him when he walked out of the bar.				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								The Maltese economy recorded an estimated net international investment position of ???1.70 billion as at the end of last year, the National Statistics Office said.
The position refers to net foreign assets and is the balance of foreign assets less foreign liabilities.
As at December, total foreign assets increased by ???2.76 billion over the position prevailing in December the previous year.
Total foreign liabilities rose by ???1.62 billion during the corresponding period, resulting in an overall increase in the IIP of ???1.14 billion.
The level of Malta???s total foreign assets abroad amounted to ???47.35 billion as at the end of December. Other Investment and Portfolio Investment accounted for 53.6 per cent and 42.3 per cent of total foreign assets respectively.
The increase in Malta???s foreign assets was characterised mainly by a ???2.83 billion increase in debt securities, primarily bonds and notes.
This was partly offset by a ???0.23 billion decline in other investments due to a fall in loans generated by the banking sector.
During the period under review, Malta???s foreign liabilities were estimated at ???45.65 billion.
Accounting for 70.9 per cent of total foreign liabilities, other investment...				]]></description>

								Former national football player Gilbert Agius was this morning acquitted of slightly injuring St Patrick???s player Josmar Farrugia at the Ta??? Qali football stadium last April.
Mr Farrugia had been hit on the nose with a soft drink can in a fight between St Patrick???s and Valletta.
The fight started when St Patrick???s goalkeeper went up to a Valletta player and kissed the badge on his shirt. 
Magistrate Consuelo Scerri Herrera acquitted Mr Agius after she took into consideration that witnesses Samuel Buhagiar and Ian Grech admitted in court to having discussed the case before testifying and to seeking their lawyer???s advice on how to testify.
Mr Agius had also alleged that Mr Farrugia had hit him in the face.
The magistrate said that the prosecution had brought no other witnesses apart from Mr Buhagiar and Mr Grech.				]]></description>

								Leading Astrologer Nicolas Aujula reveals the new royal baby prince shares the same star-sign as father Prince William and his late grandmother Princess Diana that will help keep the popularity of the royal family alive.
Born at St Mary's hospital in Paddington, London at 4.24pm yesterday, the monarch in waiting becomes the third in line to the throne. Had he been born 30 minutes later the future King would have been a Leo.
Born with four planets (the Sun, Mercury, Mars and Jupiter) in the sign of Cancer and Scorpio Rising, gives the new arrival a highly watery personality that will easily relate to people through a caring and compassionate nature - the public will simply adore him. Later on this can easily transcend into pursuing charitable efforts, just like his late grandmother Princess Diana.
"The Prince will be sentimental, intuitive, family orientated and protective to those he cares about, ensuring a strong nurturing bond between mother and child. Other notable Cancerian public figures include Nelson Mandela, Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise and Cheryl Cole.
"The royal baby would be no stranger to combat and the armed forces could be off interest that he follows in the footsteps off...				]]></description>

								Malta breached the human rights of a Somali migrant who suffered degrading conditions in an immigration detention centre, the European Court of Human Rights ruled today.
The court held that Malta should pay Aden Ahmed ???30,000 for non-pecuniary damage and ???3,000 to cover costs and expenses.
In today???s ruling, which is not final, judges held that Malta violated the European Convention on Human Rights article prohibiting inhuman or degrading treatment and that ensuring a right to liberty and security.
Ms Ahmed was placed in detention in Malta after she entering the country irregularly, by boat, to seek asylum in February 2009.
This is the first time the court found a violation against Malta concerning immigration detention conditions.
The court was concerned about the conditions in which Ms Ahmed was detained at Lyster Barracks, notably the possible exposure of detainees to the cold, the lack of female, a complete lack of access to open air and exercise for periods of up to three months, an inadequate diet and the particular vulnerability of Ms Ahmed due to her fragile health and personal emotional circumstances.
Taken as a whole, those conditions, in which she had lived for...				]]></description>

The Maltese trust each other much less than citizens of many other developed countries, according to a study on social cohesion.
Malta was ranked in the bottom tier for the extent to which people trust each other in the study by the Bertelsmann Stiftung and Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany.
The countries studied were all the EU members, except Croatia, and seven Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) states: Australia, Canada, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the US.
They were assessed on nine criteria based on social relations, connectedness and focus on the common good. For each countries were ranked in one of five tiers.
Malta was ranked in the fourth tier for overall social cohesion, down from the second tier in 2008.
Social cohesion is defined as the way members of a community live and work together.
???It is crucial for any society???s future and has a profound impact on a person???s perceived well-being. More cohesion equals more life satisfaction,??? Liz Mohn, vice-chair of the Bertelsmann Foundation???s executive board, said.
Breaking down the results further, Malta was placed in the fourth tier for acceptance of diversity, up from the bottom...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Actor Dennis Farina, a former Chicago policeman who played a TV cop on Law & Order during his wide-ranging career, has died at the age of 69.
His publicist, Lori de Waal said he died in hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona, after suffering a blood clot in his lung.
For three decades, Farina was a character actor who displayed remarkable dexterity, charm and toughness, making effective use of his craggy face, husky frame, ivory smile and ample mustache. He could be as dapper as Fred Astaire and as full of threat as Clint Eastwood. His gift has been described as wry, tough-guy panache, and audiences loved him for it.
"Sometimes you can take those dramatic roles and maybe interject a little humour into them, and I think the reverse also works," he said in a 2007 interview with the Associated Press. "One of the funny things in life to me is a guy who takes himself very seriously."
Farina's many films include Saving Private Ryan (1998), Out Of Sight (1998), Midnight Run (1988), Manhunter (1986), and his breakout and perhaps most beloved film Get Shorty (1995), a comedic romp in which he played a Miami mob boss.
He recently completed shooting a comedy film, Lucky Stiff.

								A bag snatched from the arms of a young woman in the US contained the ashes of her deceased newborn baby.
Police spokeswoman Martha Earnhardt said that Monica Thomas was carrying the cremated remains of son Jamar Simmons Jr. when she was knocked down by a robber in Montgomery, Ohio, who took her handbag.
The child only lived a couple hours after his birth, and Ms Earnhardt says Ms Thomas was carrying the remains in her bag because she planned to bury them at her mother's gravesite the following morning, on her 20th birthday.
The ashes were in a small box with the child's name and birthdate on it.
Police Sgt Mike Myrick said investigators are asking for the public's help in locating the suspect and the ashes.				]]></description>

								The power cut in Mosta that lasted 24 hours last weekend cost four companies more than ???25,000 in spoilt stock.
???We had a cold room full of frozen meats and had to throw it all away ??? enough to fill the whole store,??? said Isaac Mallia, owner of Dayfresh Meats.
Mr Mallia disposed of ???15,000 worth of frozen goods after the outage turned his cold room into a ???sauna??? over the warm summer???s night.
Lights went out in Mosta a few minutes before midnight last Friday after technical complications arose with one of Enemalta???s high tension cables.
Business owners were annoyed because they were repeatedly told by customer care operators that the power would be restored shortly.

???We waited for 24 hours! ???In an hour or so, in an hour or so...??? We waited all day and got nowhere,??? exclaimed Owen Borg, a butcher at Dayfresh who had spent several hours preparing a display of marinated meats the previous afternoon only to find it had all gone rotten by the following morning.
???It???s barbecue season and the weekend is obviously our busiest time so we were fully loaded ??? we usually sell everything,??? Mr Borg said as he dragged the remaining boxes of spoilt rib eye that had thawed overnight.
???We are...				]]></description>

								DRIVE-THROUGH REFUSAL
A woman has been given a fine after taking her horse into a McDonald's restaurant.
She was initially refused service while in the saddle in the drive-through lane of the branch in Whitefield, Greater Manchester. She then led the animal inside, where it defecated on the floor.
A statement posted on the Facebook page of Greater Manchester Police's Whitefield Division read: "The staff refused to serve the women due to company policy. The woman then took the horse into the restaurant, who ended up doing his business on the floor. The sight and smell of this caused obvious distress and upset to customers trying to eat, as well as staff members."
SUN SEEKERS
While much of the UK has been sweltering in a heatwave, meerkats have been busy soaking up the rays.
Meerkats at West Midland Safari Park in Bewdley, Worcestershire, have been more than happy to bask in the sun as the country has enjoyed its longest spell of high temperatures in seven years, keeping the mercury consistently above 30C in many areas.
According to park keepers, one of the younger pups, Eddie, has taken to stretching out on a tiny log, using it as a sun-lounger. He was one of four meerkats born at...				]]></description>

								Convicted drug trafficker Mario Camilleri and his 21-year-old son, who were found dead in a Qajjenza field last Wednesday, were asked to go there to dig up ???packets of money??? that were hidden under a pile of stones, according to Mr Camilleri???s pregnant wife.
The two men???s bodies were found partly buried in a shallow grave at the field in Qajjenza, Bir??ebbu??a, a few hours after Mona Camilleri reported them missing.

The woman???s brother, Jason Galea from Bir??ebbu??a, has been charged with their murder. He denies the charges.
Speaking to Times of Malta in the living room of her Ibra?? home, the widow said that, unlike her son Mario Jr, her husband never wanted to be involved in a treasure hunt.
???He kept saying he wanted to stay out of it as he had only come out of jail a year ago, and after all those years he wanted to enjoy time with his family. He even told my son to be careful and not to trust anyone,??? Ms Camilleri said.
???They were killed for nothing. Until sometime ago I had two strong men and now I have none.
???My son was fearless. He was so strong??? and I don???t mean in the fighting sense??? and Mario, after all that time in jail, why???? she asked.

								Officials are hoping to reopen both runways at New York's LaGuardia Airport after a plane's landing gear collapsed, sending it skidding along the tarmac and causing operations to be suspended.
The incident happened as Southwest Airlines Flight 345 touched down on the runway, officials said.
Ten passengers were treated at the scene, with six being taken to hospital with minor injuries, said Thomas Bosco, acting director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the area's airports. The six crew members were taken to another hospital for observation.
Mr Bosco said the incident forced the temporary closure of the airport, with one runway coming back into service at around 7pm local time last night.
Dallas-based Southwest said 150 people were on the domestic flight from Nashville, Tennessee, while the Port Authority said the total was 149.
Mr Bosco said the nose gear of the plane collapsed when it landed at 5.40pm and "the aircraft skidded down the runway on its nose and then veered off and came to rest in the grass area".
He said there was no advance warning of any possible problem before the landing.
