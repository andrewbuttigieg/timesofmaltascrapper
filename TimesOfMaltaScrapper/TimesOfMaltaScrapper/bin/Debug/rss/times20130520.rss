			<description><![CDATA[
								It has been two months since the general election but the University council is still not functioning after the Government appointees resigned.

The situation was flagged by University lecturer Arnold Cassola, who said academic and non-academic decisions were blocked because the Government has not yet appointed its 13 council members.
The Government commands a majority on the 24-member body that has the ultimate say on decisions that affect the University???s running.
The councillors appointed by the previous administration resigned after the election and the Education Ministry has so far failed to appoint new ones.
Prof. Cassola told Times of Malta that all letters of appointment, pending promotions and decisions related to the introduction of new courses had stalled.
The council has to rubberstamp such decisions.
???Instead of letting the council get on with its work until new councillors are nominated, in keeping with the usual tribal priorities of this country, all nominated councillors on the government-dominated body were immediately forced to resign, thus blocking all possibility of having the University carry-ing on with its essential academic (and non-academic) work,???

			<description><![CDATA[
								Pakistan has told civil servants not to wear socks as the country turns off air-conditioners amid a chronic power crisis and soaring temperatures.
The government has turned off all air-conditioning in its offices as the country endures blackouts of up to 20 hours a day in some places.
"There shall be no more use of air-conditioners in public offices till such time that substantial improvement in the energy situation takes place," a cabinet directive said.
As part of a new dress code, moccasins or sandals must be worn without socks.
The power shortages have sparked violent protests and crippled key industries, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs in a country already beset by high unemployment, a failing economy, widespread poverty and a Taliban insurgency.
The "load-shedding" means many families cannot pump water, let alone run air-conditioners, with a disastrous knock-on effect on health and domestic life.
Frustration over the power cuts contributed to the former ruling party's poor showing in a May 11 general election.
Two ministers in charge of water and power explained what can be done to end power cuts in parts of the country enduring temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius and...				]]></description>

								A Brazilian man died when a hot air balloon flying over Cappadocia, a tourist destination in central Turkey, collided with another balloon this morning.
Another 24 people were injured, the Anatolia news agency said.
Most of the injured arebeing treated for broken bones but one was in critical condition.
Video posted on a social media website appeared to show a hot air balloon plummeting to the ground and deflating.
Cappadocia is most famous for its unique geological features called fairy chimneys. Balloon rides are a popular way to see the cone-like formations, created by the erosion of volcanic ash around them.				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								North Korea fired two short-range missiles on Monday, making six launches in three days, and it condemned South Korea for criticising what it said were its legitimate military drills.
South Korea's Defence Ministry said North Korea had fired one missile on Monday morning and a second one in the afternoon. Both were fired into the sea off North Korea's east coast, a ministry official said.
The launches come hard on the heels of more than two months of threats from North Korea that it would wage a nuclear war against South Korea and the United States if it were attacked.
The North condemned joint U.S. and South Korean military exercises, that ended in late April, as a rehearsal for an attack on its territory.
"We are conducting intense military exercises to strengthen our defence capacity," North Korea's KCNA news agency quoted the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, the body that handles inter-Korean issues, as saying on Monday.
"Our military is conducting these exercises in order to cope with the mounting war measures from the U.S. and South Korea, which is the legitimate right of any sovereign country."
North Korea frequently fires short-range missiles, although...				]]></description>

								A German national, Reuben Rudtke, has started undergoing extradition proceedings for the alleged distribution of child pornography.
The man was arrested in Malta recently and is wanted in the United States.
Dr Donatella Frendo Dimech, deputy attorney general, told a court that the man was arrested in October 2011 in the United States and ordered to wear a tracking device.
Some three days before he was due to stand trial, he threw the device away, went to Germany and came to Malta where he has been joined by his wife. His parents also live here.
Dr Frendo Dimech said that paperwork known as the 'authority to proceed' and other documents have still not been received from the United States.
Lawyers Lucio Schriha and Abigail Bugeja filed an application for bail, saying Mr Rudtke has ties in Malta and will not abscond.
Dr Frendo Dimech said he had left the US before his trial and she strongly objected to bail.
Magistrate Neville Camilleri postponed the decision, which will later be given in camera. Mr Rudtke will be kept under arrest.

								A man who was run over while on a pedestrian crossing has been awarded over ???38,000 in damages by Mr Justice Lino Farrugia Sacco in the First Hall of the Civil Court.
Alex Azzopardi filed his writ for damages against Anna Ellul. Middle Sea Insurance plc later intervened into the law suit.
Mr Azzopardi told the court that he was crossing Valletta Road in Mosta on the pedestrian crossing when the lights permitted him to do so. While crossing the road he was hit by a car driven by Ms Ellul and suffered injuries including a fracture to his knee cap and facial injuries.
Ms Ellul told the court that the traffic lights were obscured by trees and that she could not see the lights due to the sun in her eyes.
But Mr Justice Farrugia Sacco said that it was the duty of every driver to maintain a proper look out and he found Ms Ellul totally responsible for the accident and for the injuries sustained by Mr Azzopardi.
The court found that Mr Azzopardi had suffered a six per cent permanent disability and ordered Ms Ellul and her insurers to pay him ???38,630.58 in damages.				]]></description>

								A testicular cancer survivor has written a novel inspired by his experience to raise awareness about the disease that left him psychologically shattered and feeling ???inferior to other men???.
Being diagnosed with cancer and removing his right testicle, while keeping it a secret from most of his family and friends, gave the man the urge to speak up and raise awareness.
But the fact that some loved ones are still in the dark, coupled with the shame of having lost a testicle, led him to decide to write the book using the nom de plume R. Itchy Knob Flodna ??? a hint of the humorous streak that runs through the novel.
The book, The Monster Between My Legs, tells the story of a porn star who is diagnosed with testicular cancer and, when faced with the fear of death, tries to rectify past wrongs. Although the author is Maltese, it is set in the UK.
Having testicular cancer is clearly not funny, but the author believes that some humour is healthy and can help drive the message home.

???All cancer stories, rightly so, are sad stories. But the worse thing we can do is take ourselves too seriously all the time. Once you get over the sad part, life will start getting better again. For me, looking...				]]></description>

								Nationalist MEP Roberta Metsola has asked the European Commission if the forced resignation of former Malta Communications Authority chairman Antonio Ghio was in line with EU law.

Dr Metsola tabled a parliamentary question on Monday asking whether a change in the government of a member state constituted grounds for the removal of the head of a national regulatory authority under the EU Telecoms Framework Directive.
Due to internal EU procedures, the question is not expected to be sent to the European Commission or published online until this week.
Dr Ghio offered his resignation as authority chairman on March 14 after being requested to do so by the new Labour government in a letter on March 12.
In the letter, the permanent secretary at the Communications Ministry at the time, John Gatt, informed Dr Ghio and his fellow board members that their resignations were ???customary... to enable the new government to effect any changes that are considered desirable???. In his resignation letter, Dr Ghio made it clear his decision to step down was forced and that he did not feel he was obliged to do so according to the conditions laid out in national and EU law.

???I want justice. Before I leave this world I want to know that my mother???s case has been closed. You can???t imagine what it feels like ??? having your mother killed by someone who is not held responsible.

								A Maltese tuna rancher can continue legal action against marine conservation group Sea Shepherd in the UK, a high court has ruled.

Fish and Fish won an appeal after a UK court last year threw out a lawsuit against Sea Shepherd in which the Maltese company sought damages for an incident that happened in 2010.
The company claimed it incurred ???1 million in damages after the Steve Irwin, a ship belonging to Sea Shepherd, rammed their tuna pen on the high seas. The incident formed part of the marine group???s Operation Blue Rage campaign against blue fin tuna fishing.
Two vessels working for Fish and Fish were towing cages containing live blue fin tuna from Libya to its fish farm in Malta when the highly publicised incident happened.
The company claimed that some 33 tonnes of tuna from a total catch of 64 tonnes were released into the sea by divers from the Steve Irwin.
Some of the Maltese crew were also injured.
Fish and Fish took legal action in London against Sea Shepherd UK, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and Paul Watson, who skippered the ship and is the founder of the conservation group. Captain Watson is also a director of the UK branch.
The court had dismissed the case...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Marriage between a man and woman is ???sorely needed??? in today???s society and it could soon be ???too late??? to save that union, the leader of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales has said.

In a wide-ranging attack on Coalition policies, the Archbishop of Westminster, the Most Rev. Vincent Nichols, accused David Cameron of seeking to undermine a centuries-old understanding of matrimony.
He said support for marriage and family stability was now an urgent priority that ???no intelligent government??? could ignore.
His comments come just days before MPs debate the same-sex marriage Bill which faces its next Commons hurdle this week.
Mr Cameron has made the controversial legislation a key symbol of his efforts to modernise the Conservatives but the issue has caused divisions in his party.
During a service at Westminster Cathedral, where more than 600 couples renewed their vows, the Archbishop said marriage was an ???exclusive??? commitment between a man and a woman.
???This witness you give, to the true nature of marriage in its natural and supernatural meaning, is a witness that is sorely needed today,??? he said.
???It stands against those trends in our society which seek to undermine this...				]]></description>

								British Prime Minister David Cameron is ???losing control of his party???, Conservative Party grandee Geoffrey Howe said yesterday, as a row raged over whether a close aide to Cameron had labelled grassroots activists ???mad, swivel-eyed loons???.

The furore threatens to further alienate Cameron and his inner circle from the core of his party, with whom ties are already almost at breaking point.
Differences with the grassroots over Britain???s membership of the European Union and Cameron???s support for legalising same-sex marriage have raised questions over his leadership and could hurt the party???s chances in the next election, due in 2015.
???Sadly, by making it clear in January that he opposes the current terms of UK membership of the EU, the Prime Minister has opened a Pandora???s box politically and seems to be losing control of his party in the process,??? Howe wrote in an article for The Observer newspaper.
Howe was former prime minister Margaret Thatcher???s longest-serving Cabinet minister, but fell out with her over relations with Europe and is best remembered for a scathing resignation speech that helped topple her as leader in 1990.
Cameron???s Conservatives have been rattled by the...				]]></description>

								Pope Francis warned the Catholic Church to not close in on itself at a Mass to mark Pentecost Sunday attended by thousands, urging the faithful to be open and present in a new and changing world.
The Church should ask itself daily whether it is resisting new challenges and remaining ???barricaded in transient structures which have lost their capacity for openness to what is new,??? he said.
???Newness always makes us a bit fearful, because we feel more secure if we have everything under control,??? Pope Francis said in his homily in front of a packed St Peter???s Square, adding that change can bring fulfilment.
The Pentecost Mass marks the day the Church says the Holy Spirit descended on Christ???s apostles, or disciples, and is regarded as the birthday of the Church.
Pope Francis warned of the threat of an institution which is ???self-referential, closed in on herself,??? and spoke of the courage to ???take to the streets of the world??? and reach ???the very outskirts of existence???.
Since his election in March as the leader of the world???s 1.2 billion Catholics, Pope Francis has been urging Church leaders to go out into their communities and help the poor and suffering, rather than focusing on...				]]></description>
