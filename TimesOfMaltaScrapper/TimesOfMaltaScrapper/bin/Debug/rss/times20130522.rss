								European leaders will be meeting today to discuss strategic reviews of the EU???s energy policy and cooperation to fight tax evasion.
Today???s discussion on energy is mostly strategic but will lay the foundation for a more detailed discussion by EU energy ministers in June.
Malta, which is represented by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, is particularly keen on strengthening the EU???s resolve to invest on connectivity and provide funding for projects which link isolated countries to the European network.
Malta has already benefitted from funding for its ???200 million electricity interconnector with Sicily. However, feasibility studies have also been launched on the possibility to build a gas pipeline.
If viable, the pipeline would be a long term alternative to the government short term plans to build a Liquefied Natural Gas terminal that would supply the new, privately-financed gas-fired power station is being planned at Delimara.
The draft conclusions on tax evasion are also short on concrete measures, which would have to be developed in the coming months.
However, the EU leaders are expected to urge the European Commission to kick start immediate discussions with a number of third...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Hundreds of youths have set fire to cars and attacked police and rescue services in poor immigrant suburbs in three nights of rioting in Stockholm, Sweden's worst disorder in years.
On Tuesday night, a police station in the Jakobsberg area in the northwest of the city was attacked, two schools were damaged and an arts and crafts centre was set ablaze, despite a call for calm from Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt.
The riots in one of Europe's richest capitals have shocked a country that prides itself on a reputation for social justice, and fuelled a debate about how Sweden is coping with both youth unemployment and an influx of immigrants.
"We've had around 30 cars set on fire last night, fires that we connect to youth gangs and criminals," Kjell Lindgren, spokesman for Stockholm police, said on Wednesday.
He said eight people had been arrested on Tuesday night, but there were no reports of injuries.
The riots appear to have been sparked by the police killing of a 69-year-old man wielding a machete in the suburb of Husby this month, which prompted accusations of police brutality.
"Everyone must pitch in to restore calm - parents, adults," Reinfeldt told reporters on Tuesday.

								The number of people registering for work in April stood at 7,176, 403 more than in the same month last year, but 174 less than in March.
Administrative records held by the Employment and Training Corporation indicate a year-on-year increase of 601 persons (9.9 per cent) registering for work under Part 1 of the unemployment register.
Those registering under Part 1 are new job seekers and people who have been made redundant.
On the other hand, people registering under Part 2 dropped by 198, or 28.9 per cent, to 486.
People registering under Part 2 have been dismissed from work due to disciplinary action, left work of their own free will, refused work or training opportunities or were struck off the register after an inspection by law enforcement personnel.
The NSO said that in the 12 months to April, registered unemployment on the mainland increased by 377, or 6.2 per cent, while that for Gozo increased by 26, or 3.6 per cent.
The number of registered unemployed aged 45 and over increased by 173, or 6.2 per cent. Conversely, the number of registered unemployed aged under 20 declined by 13.5 per cent.
When compared to the corresponding month a year ago, registrants whose duration of...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Millions of Italians cannot afford to heat their homes properly or eat meat as their country is racked by recession and soaring unemployment, according to a report which found the number of people considered seriously deprived had doubled in the past two years.
The findings from national statistics institute ISTAT underline the scale of the challenge faced by the new coalition government of Enrico Letta, which has vowed to stimulate growth and tackle a youth jobless rate of almost 40 percent.
A recession that has lasted almost two years has taken a heavy toll on ordinary Italians who are increasingly digging into their savings, ISTAT said in its annual report.
Italy has the highest level in Europe of young people who are neither in education nor employment, at 23.9 percent, the study showed. In Italy's impoverished south, one in three people aged 15-29 fell into this group.
The number of people living in families considered to be seriously deprived has doubled in the past two years to 8.6 million, or about 14 percent of the population, ISTAT said.
Families who meet more than four of nine poverty indicators are considered seriously deprived. These include not being able to heat...				]]></description>

								The Kummissjoni Nazzjonali Persuni b???Di??abilita filed an application in court against the Malta Football Association for failing to provide adequate access to the Ta??? Qali National Stadium???s Enclosure Side.
By failing to provide access for all facilities, the MFA is in breach of the Equal Opportunities Act of 2000, the KNDP, which is the entity responsible for safeguarding the rights of disabled people said.
In its application, KNPD stated that it received several complaints about the lack of accessibility at this public building. KNPD asserted that MFA failed to take remedial action to improve access to the national stadium???s most commonly used part despite the extensive correspondence and efforts at mediation - including an on-site visit - and a judicial protest filed before the court.
These actions were taken in an effort to resolve the situation and ensure compliance, it said.
KNDP said that while the stadium???s Millennium Stand was accessible, it was hardly ever opened for local topflight games.
KNPD is calling upon the court to order the MFA to comply with its legal requirements and render facilities, including the entrance, stands, cafeteria and sanitary facilities...				]]></description>

								A fireworks manufacturer was this morning acquitted of having caused an incident which led to a 13-year-old boy losing an eye.
The incident happened in Floriana in 2009 during the ground fireworks festival when a piece of a Catherine wheel became dislodged and hit the boy, Kurt Connor in an eye.
He had been watching the festival with friends behind police barriers.
In handing down judgement, the court said that insufficient evidence had been presented for a conviction. The court could not decide, on the basis of the available evidence, whether proper manufacturing processes had been followed and whether adequate safety precautions in the letting off of the fireworks had been observed.
The accused, Manuel Farrugia, 71, holder of a Licence A for fireworks manufacturing for 40 years, was therefore acquitted, without prejudice to possible civil proceedings.
The court also urged the insurance company which covered the festival to compensate the boy.??
Drs Marushka Debono and Michael Falzon were defence counsel.				]]></description>

The crash involved a VW Golf driven by a 48-year-old from Marsa heading towards Birzebbuga and a green Maruti 800 driven by a 75-year-old from Zejtun.
The Maruti, which was crossing the road towards Zejtun, was overturned and pushed into a wall with the force of impact. The driver was trapped in his vehicle and was rescued by Civil Protection rescuers using cutting equipment.
The driver of the other vehicle was not hurt, but both vehicles were extensively damaged.

								Singer William Mangion, who represented Malta at the 1993 Eurovision Song Contest, has been appointed coordinator for the promotion of local bands.
Mr Mangion said he had been offered a one-year contract by the Government to help in the identification of a place where bands could rehearse.
???The proposal was made in Article 24 of the Labour manifesto and my job will be to try and identify such a place,??? he said when contacted yesterday.
Mr Mangion, who had taken part in the Eurovision with the song This Time, had appeared in a Labour Party promotion video in which he sang the praises of Joseph Muscat ???because he delivers on his promises???.
Mr Mangion said the letter of appointment was issued by the Office of the Prime Minister but he had not yet signed the contract.
???I have no idea of the conditions and pay but for me the most important thing is to work in a field that I know first-hand,??? he said when asked what his remuneration would be.
With a 40-year career in the music scene, Mr Mangion said he knew what it felt like when bands had no place to rehearse.
His appointment follows that of other Labour Party sympathisers and billboard boys and girls to various public agencies after...				]]></description>

								Microsoft has unveiled its next generation video games console, the Xbox One.
At an event at its US headquarters in Redmond, Washington, which was streamed around the world, the electronics giant said the new voice and motion-controlled device was an "all-in-one system" for games, live television, films and music.
Don Mattrick, president of the interactive entertainment business at Microsoft, yesterday told the audience and millions of people over the internet: "Today we put you at the centre of a new generation in the living room - where your games look and feel like nothing else, where your TV becomes more intelligent, where all of your entertainment comes alive in one place.
"Team Xbox is on a new mission - design and build an all-in-one system to light up a new generation of games, TV and entertainment."
The sleek black console, with a new Kinect camera sensor and game pad, is the successor to the hugely successful Xbox 360 which sold a reported 77 million consoles around the world.
The new machine, which will be released later this year, sees Microsoft add a blu-ray drive to its console and the use of video calling service Skype.

								A unique first edition of "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" annotated by author J.K. Rowling has sold for a record 150,000 poundsat a London charity auction, Sotheby's said.
The 1997 book, featuring handwritten notes, 22 original illustrations and a 43-page "second thoughts" commentary by the author, fetched the highest price to date for a printed book by Rowling, Sotheby's said in a statement.
The auction house said the sale room fell silent on Tuesday as buyers engaged in a bidding war for the coveted book, which eventually went to a unidentified buyer bidding over the telephone.
The full sale featured 51 first editions, all unique one-offs featuring annotations and commentary from authors, as part of the "First Editions, Second Thoughts" sale to benefit charity organization English PEN, which promotes freedom of expression.
Other top sellers included Roald Dahl's "Matilda" with new illustrations by Quentin Blake for 30,000 pounds ($45,470), Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the Day" for 18,000 pounds ($27,278) and Julian Barnes' "Metroland" for 14,000 ($21,216).

								The following are the top stories in the Maltese and overseas press.
The Times of Malta says tuna quotas may be increased next year. It also reports how a court decided that a topless dancer did not offend public morals. 
The Malta Independent says energy and tax evasion will take centre stage in the EU heads of government summit today.
l-orizzont says the former Cabinet members refunded ???1 for every ???6 they got in their pay rises.
MaltaToday also leads with the same story.
In-Nazzjon says work has started on the updating of the PN statute. It gives prominence to the meeting which Simon Busuttil had with Gianluca Bezzina. It also says the government has dropped claims for ???9m from BWSC.
The overseas press
Fox News reports that rescue workers in the Oklahoma City suburb hit by Monday???s devastating tornado have said the search for survivors and the dead was nearly complete. The tornado destroyed countless homes, cleared lots down to bare red earth and claimed 24 lives, including those of nine children.
Le Soir says leaders of recession-hit Europe will make a fresh attempt at fighting tax fraud and evasion worth, a trillion euros a year, at a summit in Brussels later today. However,...				]]></description>

								European Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Commissioner Maria Damanaki indicated yesterday she might propose a ???slight increase??? in the tuna quota.

However, she advised against re-opening talks on the agreement between European Union member states on how the quota should be distributed, saying that might not be in Malta???s interests.
Speaking to Times of Malta yesterday, Ms Damanaki said that since scientific data indicated that tuna stocks in the Mediterranean were recovering, she might ask for a slight increase in the quota for the 2014 season.
???We will follow scientific advice and our proposals will be aligned to the new data,??? she said.
???There are indications that bluefin stocks are slightly recovering in the Mediterranean and our proposals will reflect that.???
Until a few years ago, the fishing of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean was unregulated.
Stocks dwindled heavily due to overfishing, to the extent that some scientists were predicting a possible extinction of the lucrative species.
The European Commission, in agreement with the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, introduced a management plan in 2006, slashing quotas allocated to member...				]]></description>

In response to a series of questions sent by Times of Malta, the spokeswoman of President George Abela said: ???The President of Malta has nothing further to add to what was discussed in yesterday???s TVHemm journalistic programme.???

The newspaper specified that it only required the sections of the minutes relevant to the case of Darleen Zerafa, to whom the offer was made unanimously by the board on October 4 last year.

								Three lawyers have complained to the European Court of Human Rights about inconsistencies in judgments handed down by the Constitutional Court.
David Camilleri, Joseph Gatt and Franco Debono, a former Nationalist MP who was appointed Law Commissioner by the Labour Government, focused on a long-standing issue about a suspect???s right to a lawyer during interrogation by the police.
They said that their client, Martin Dimech, was awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges.
He was claiming breach of human rights on the ground that he did not have legal assistance during police investigations. The claim was upheld.
The Attorney General appealed and the Constitutional Court overturned the ruling, the lawyers told the European Court.
They argued that ???diametrically opposed reasoning??? in many conflicting judgments ran counter to the principle of legal certainty, which was at the very heart of the provisions of the European Human Rights Convention.
???The Constitutional Court, being the supreme court of Malta, should have continued establishing a linear interpretation rather than becoming itself the actual source of legal uncertainty. It is the duty of the supreme court of a State to resolve...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Just four days have passed since the Eurovision final in Sweden and conspiracy theories abound, with Azerbaijan questioning the televoting system and Lithuania pointing fingers at Azerbaijan???s ???lobbying??? tactics.

Malta has been spared the blame, but social media users were bandying about theories on why Malta gave its ???douze points??? to Azerbaijan in the final for the second year running, contributing to its second placing in the contest.
Azerbaijan reciprocated with eight points both years. In 2011, Malta gave Azerbaijan 10 points.
Anton Attard, head of the Maltese delegation, said that ahead of the contest, Malta used social media to promote Gianluca???s song Tomorrow in several countries and Azerbaijan was one of the targets.
???We consider it to be fertile ground, in the sense that the chances of a campaign working there are high; the public is always very receptive to our songs,??? he said.
Azerbaijan also campaigns actively in Malta year in, year out.
???Their singer, Farid, was on Xarabank so the Maltese viewers would have been familiar with him,??? he said. Mr Attard pointed out that the jury???s vote made up just 50 per cent of the final result, the other half being in viewers??? hands...				]]></description>

								Emergency workers pulled more than 100 survivors from the rubble of homes, schools and a hospital in an Oklahoma town hit by a powerful tornado, and officials lowered the death toll from the storm to 24, including nine children.
The two-mile (three-km) wide tornado tore through Moore outside Oklahoma City on Monday afternoon, trapping victims beneath the rubble, wiping out entire neighbourhoods and tossing vehicles about as if they were toys.
Seven of the nine children who were killed died at Plaza Towers Elementary School, which took a direct hit, but many more survived unhurt.
???They literally were lifting walls up and kids were coming out,??? Oklahoma State Police Sergeant Jeremy Lewis said.
???They pulled kids out from under cinder blocks without a scratch on them.???
The Oklahoma state medical examiner???s office said 24 bodies had been recovered from the wreckage, down from the 51 they had reported earlier. The earlier number likely reflected some double-counted deaths, said Amy Elliott, chief administrative officer for the medical examiner.
???There was a lot of chaos,??? she said.
Thunderstorms and lightning slowed the rescue effort on Tuesday, but 101 people had been pulled from the...				]]></description>

								Syria said its troops destroyed an Israeli vehicle that crossed into its territory from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights yesterday and warned that any attempt to violate its sovereignty would meet ???immediate and firm retaliation???.

Israel said the incident took place on its side of the Golan ceasefire line, that the vehicle was damaged but not destroyed, none of its soldiers were hurt and they returned fire.
The clash highlighted the potential for renewed conflict along a frontline that has become increasingly fraught after nearly four decades of calm overseen by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his father. It also followed Israeli airstrikes near Damascus against suspected missile stockpiles two weeks ago, after which Syria threatened to retaliate.
Assad is battling a two-year-old uprising in which rebel forces, including radical Islamists, have taken swathes of rural territory and attacked army posts near the Golan frontier.
There are frequent reports of cross-border gunfire from Syria during clashes between army and rebel forces but yesterday???s incident was the first time since the start of the crisis that Syria???s armed forces said they targeted Israel???s military.

			<description><![CDATA[
								EU regulators confirmed yesterday that they will cap bonuses of bankers earning more than ???500,000 a year and added other conditions to make the pay ceiling harder to smash.

The headline figure was leaked last Friday, triggering warnings by banks in the European Union that they may lose staff to other parts of the world, and that London, the bloc???s top financial centre, could be damaged.
Accounting firm PwC predicted that the number of London bankers affected will be 10 times the number hit by current pay curbs.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) said the purpose of the draft rules, out for public consultation until August 21, is to have a common definition for national regulators within the EU to decide which bankers will come within the pay curb net.
The EBA is fleshing out a new EU law that includes the bonus cap, which lawmakers say is needed to crack down on excessive risk-taking at banks. The cap will hit bonuses awarded for 2014 and due to be handed out in early 2015.
The EU already applies a tougher version of bank pay limits agreed by world leaders during the financial crisis and the cap will be the toughest curb of its kind in the world.
Based on data from 23 banks,...				]]></description>

								Religious observers are asking: ???Is Pope Francis an exorcist???? after an incident in St Peter???s Square.
The Pope laid his hands on the head of a young man after celebrating Mass. The man heaved deeply a half-dozen times, convulsed and shook, and then slumped in his wheelchair as Francis prayed over him.
The television station of the Italian bishops??? conference said it had surveyed exorcists, who agreed that Francis either performed an exorcism or a prayer to free the man from the devil.
The Vatican was more cautious, saying Francis ???didn???t intend to perform any exorcism???.
???But as he often does for the sick or suffering, he simply intended to pray for someone.???
Fuelling the speculation is Francis??? obsession with the devil, a frequent subject of his homilies.

There has been an apparent surge in demand for exorcisms among the faithful despite the irreverent treatment the rite often receives from Hollywood.
Who can forget the green vomit and the spinning head of the possessed girl in the 1973 cult classic The Exorcist?
In his very first homily as pope on March 14, Francis warned cardinals gathered in the Sistine Chapel the day after he was elected that ???he who doesn???t pray to the Lord...				]]></description>
