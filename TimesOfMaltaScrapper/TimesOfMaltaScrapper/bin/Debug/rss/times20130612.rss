								Colonel David Attard, Deputy Commander of the AFM, is to become the commandant of Safi Detention Centre while Lt Col Brian Gatt will head the other detention centres in the first phase of a reform of the Detention Service, informed sources said this afternoon.
The Safi Detention Centre is by far the largest detention centre for migrants in Malta.
The detention centres will eventually be merged into one facility under a unified command which will be independent of the AFM.
Col Attard was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1988 and graduated from infantry colleges in Italy and the United States. He also achieved a masters degree in defence studies from King's College London and also qualified from the advanced command and staff college, Joint Services Staff College, UK.				]]></description>

								Britain is to regulate electronic cigarettes as non-prescription medicine from 2016 in an attempt to improve quality, though the country's drugs watchdog said they would still be sold in convenience stores.
Healthcare authorities around the world are grappling with how to deal with the battery-driven devices, which allow users to inhale nicotine-laced vapour and are increasingly popular as a less harmful alternative to smoking.

A few countries have banned them - such as Brazil, Norway and Singapore - while others are opting for varying degrees of regulation, in some cases including restrictions on advertising and curbs on their use in public places.
Under the new British system, manufacturers will have to prove the quality of their products and demonstrate that they deliver the correct amount of nicotine. But they will not need to conduct clinical trials.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said on Wednesday that existing e-cigarettes on the market were not good enough. However, manufacturers have time to raise their game and apply for a licence, allowing them to sell regulated devices as over-the-counter products from 2016.

								The Nationalist Party has requested an explanation after two versions of a reply to a parliamentary question were issued yesterday.
Nationalist MP Marthese Portelli had asked Health Minister Godfrey Farrugia how many consultants, including persons of trust, were engaged by his ministry. She also requested their terms of reference and contract details.
In the written reply distributed to MPs, the minister said there was only one consultant, and he gave the details.
However, in the reply posted online by the House of Representatives, the minister said there were no consultants.
The PN asked why the reply was changed. It noted that the Deputy Speaker, who was in the Chair yesterday, had agreed that an investigation should be carried out.??				]]></description>

								The Gaia Foundation, which manages Ramla Bay in Gozo, has defended the use of a bullzozer to remove pebbles from the beach early last Friday.
In a statement, it said no intervention took place on the sand dunes. Stones extraneous to the site were removed while excess amount of pebbles were placed along the water course, to remain within the natural eco system.
"The works that were carried out did not effect the ecological integrity of the site, but restored the normal state of the beach that was disturbed by the denuding of sand beneath the Belancourt battery and the presence of the said stones extraneous to the natural elements of the beach," the foundation said.
In its statement, the foundation explained that over the years it has observed that sand is blown away from the area beneath the Belancourt Battery to the other side of the beach in a South Westerly direction by the prevailing North Westerlies. This sand is usually replaced by sand washed ashore with the current with the North Easterly winds. When these North Easterlies do not blow often, this part of the beach remains denuded of sand.

								New rules laying down common procedures and deadlines for handling asylum applications and basic rights for asylum seekers arriving in the EU were endorsed by the European Parliament today.
During the debate yesterday, Maltese MEPs, both Labour and Nationalists, expressed disappointment that the new package does not include provisions for solidarity, particularly through the transfer of migrants from the country where they would have landed.
In an explanation of the new rules, the European Parliament explained that current EU law does not impose specific deadlines on member states for deciding on asylum applications. To iron out differences between national asylum procedures, the new rules bring in common deadlines for handling asylum applications (a standard six-month deadline with limited exceptions), stricter rules on training staff dealing with asylum seekers and new provisions for the special needs of unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable persons.

								Air Malta lit up Gnejna Bay with over 430 candles for a commercial released on its YouTube channel today.
The video shows Gnejna beach lit by a grid of candles some of which were lit and extinguished in a planned sequence to create moving time lapse animation picture frames.
The unusual ???candle??? sequences feature a number of iconic Maltese images including a typical ???Gardjola??? (watchtower) and the ubiquitous summer fireworks displays.
The project was filmed in a single night under the supervision of internationally acclaimed photographer Kurt Arrigo. 434 candles were used to make this clip.
???We are looking for new and interesting ways to capture people???s imagination,??? said Philip Saunders, Air Malta???s Chief Commercial Officer.
???We wanted to take something in common use and utilise these beautifulcandles to tell our Maltese story.?????
The song of the clip, ???Il-Mara Fuq il-Bejt??? was composed by Maltese folkpop band Stalko, and taken from their album, Grandiloquence.				]]></description>

								The police have still not verified Austin Gatt???s declarations about his Swiss bank account but Times of Malta can reveal it was valued at more than ???700,000 when the former Transport Minister forgot to declare it in 2005.

In the heat of the election campaign, Dr Gatt admitted to having the account, which, he said, he had forgotten to include in his declaration of assets.
At a press conference on February 15, called to deny any involvement in the Enemalta oil scandal, Dr Gatt had said the account was opened by his father in 1973 and he inherited it when his mother had passed away.
He said there had been no transactions in the account for 40 years, apart from cumulative interest. A day later, he provided the police with the necessary details to investigate the account.
What was not known then is that on February 18 ??? three days after the press conference ??? Dr Gatt wrote to the Speaker of the House to amend his annual declaration of assets for the years 2005 to 2011.
In his letter, Dr Gatt gave details of his account and revealed that he had lost about ???200,000 during the 2008 economic downturn.

								Melita has launched a new 250 megabit/second internet service - the fastest velocity in Malta.
That is more than double the former top velocity service of 100 megabits/second.
The new speed is available from today at Tigne' Point and Fort Cambridge and will be gradually rolled out to other areas in the coming weeks.
CEO Andrei Torriani said the need for this speed was felt in view of an increase in demand for bandwidth and fast data transfer. Many services were moving online, such as media, security services and consumer and business interactions, Mr Torriani said.
There was also strong demand from the on-line gaming sector.
He said that in 75% of Maltese households, there was at least one person using Melita services. Since 2007, Melita had invested ???75m in various projects and it planned to invest ???60 million more to strengthen its infrastructure. The company employs 450.
The launch was made during a tour of the Melita offices by Edward Zammit Lewis, Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness. He said developments such as this enabled Malta to achieve its European Digital Agenda targets, which include better access and better products at the lowest possible prices.

								There are many ways to describe Fatumo Farah: she is a mother of three, a Master???s graduate in Business Administration and a Somali refugee who has been living in the Netherlands for the past 21 years.
But above all, she is a source of inspiration, as well as information, for countless other migrants.
As the executive director of HIRDA (Himilo Relief and Development Association), a Dutch-Somali NGO working on refugee relief, the 43-year-old is an example of how refugees can successfully integrate into other cultures and also become leaders and active ambassadors for their own communities and broader civil society.
She was invited to Malta as part of Aditus Foundation and Integra Foundation???s Our Voice project, which aims to support refugee integration on the island.

Yesterday, she met a number of Somali women living in Malta and talked publicly about refugee civic participation.
Ms Farah has travelled to various countries to deliver her message on female empowerment, political participation and what she sees as the key to it all ??? education.

In the trial by jury of David Zerafa, 39, of Nadur, who is pleading not guilty to murdering Dr Grech, 46, jurors today heard two prisoners claim that the accused had told them about committing the murder.
The testimony of Stephen Spiteri, who is now deceased, was read out.
Mr Spiteri had said that he knew the accused at St Luke???s Hospital???s St Michaels Ward, where prisoners were kept.
Mr Zerafa was chatting with him about personal matters when he started crying and confessed to him about killing the lawyer. He told him he had killed him because he had slept with his wife.
Mr Zerafa had told Mr Spiteri that when Gozitans did something they did it well. He said that they had waited for the victim to put away his car and then waited by his front door.
They shot him and bashed him in, then saw a car and hid.

The witness claimed that he was offered money by Mr Zerafa's brother-in-law not to testify.
In a confrontation, he had initially denied having said that but then said it was true but it was a joke.
Mr Spiteri had testified that...				]]></description>

								Journalists fired from Greece's state TV and radio have refused to leave the broadcaster's headquarters, continuing internet programming as the country's conservative-led government faced political crisis a year after taking office.
State TV and radio signals were cut early today after the government closed the Hellenic Broadcasting Corp, ERT, and fired its 2,500 workers, citing the need to cut "incredible waste" as the bailed out country endures a sixth year of recession.
But thousands of protesters remained outside ERT's giant headquarters in Aghia Paraskevi, north of Athens, through the night as journalists continued a live broadcast which was streamed online.
Journalist unions called a 24-hour strike, halting private television news programmes, while the government's centre-left coalition partners demanded that ERT's closure be reversed
A government spokesman had described ERT as a "haven of waste" and said its 2,500 employees would be compensated and the company would reopen "as soon as possible" with a smaller workforce.
"ERT is a typical example of unique lack of transparency and incredible waste. And that ends today," he said. "It costs three to seven times as much as...				]]></description>
