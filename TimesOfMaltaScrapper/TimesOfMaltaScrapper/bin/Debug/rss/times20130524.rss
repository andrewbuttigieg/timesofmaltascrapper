								PN deputy leadership candidate CLAUDETTE BUTTIGIEG, the party???s spokeswoman for civil liberties, tells Christian Peregin she is encouraged by the party???s internal discussions on sensitive issues.
Why did you decide to contest for the deputy leadership?
Sometimes in life people around you see you in a way which perhaps you don???t see yourself. This is what happened to me when I started being approached by several people who told me I should consider contesting for one of the highest posts in the party.
Including leadership?
Yes, and I thought this was too soon and too abrupt.
After all, you had just been elected MP for the first time.
I also felt it would be totally misinterpreted as being presumptuous. My immediate reaction was no, but as time went by I understood where this was coming from. It came from reading the electoral result, which told us we need to change. That???s when I realised people were seeing me as part of this change.

The role of deputy leader was split in two after you made your announcement to contest. Why did you choose to contest for the position related to party affairs and not parliamentary affairs?
I???m actually thankful the decision was made because when I...				]]></description>

								The Ministry for Health said today that 23 children had been reported to be suffering from slapped cheek syndrome since the beginning of this year in various localities in Malta.
Slapped cheek syndrome is a viral infection that is most common in children, although it can affect anyone of any age. It is caused by a virus called a parvovirus which is spread in much the same way as the cold or flu viruses through infected secretions from the nose and throat. Most children will not need treatment as slapped cheek syndrome is usually a very mild condition that passes in a few days.
The main symptom is a blotchy red rash on the face, resembling slapped cheeks, that could later spread to other parts of the body.
Prevention of spread is by frequent hand washing.
The ministry said that if a pregnant woman acquires the infection before 20 weeks of pregnancy, as might happen in other infections during this stage of pregnancy, there is a slightly higher risk of miscarriage. In such a case where a pregnant woman is exposed to an infected child she should consult her gynaecologist for necessary investigations.
"There is no need for alarm. The Ministry for Health is raising awareness about this...				]]></description>

								Former Finance Minister Tonio Fenech has denied badmouthing Malta in a recent meeting with the International Monetary Fund, insisting that he had a clear conscience and had actually defended the country.
He was contacted after Prime Minister Joseph Muscat in Brussels claimed that a member of the previous administration ??? whom he refused to name ??? had incited IMF representatives during a recent meeting he had with them.
???We know there was someone, who, for instance, was inciting the IMF because he is not in government anymore and told the IMF that there are problems, which only three months ago he was saying did not exist. The IMF itself told us this. When they told us who had told them this we were surprised,??? he told journalists on the sidelines of an EU summit in Brussels.
Asked to name the individual, Dr Muscat said: ???I think you can ask around.???
Dr Muscat was speaking in the context of the Excessive Deficit Procedure that the European Commission is expected to take against Malta for its failure to keep within the deficit threshold of the eurozone.
In spite of the procedures, Dr Muscat said the Government had managed to convince the Europ-ean Commission against the need for...				]]></description>

								The following are the top stories in the Maltese and overseas press
The Times of Malta says Eddie Fenech Adami is expected to make a full recovery. It also quotes former Finance Minister Tonio Fenech saying he did not badmouth Malta but defended it in a meeting with an IMF delegation. 
The Malta Independent also leads with Fenech Adami's hospitalisation. It also says the victims of sexual abuse by priests will file a claim for compensation today. 
In-Nazzon says the yardstick of meritocracy has been broken into a thousand bits by the government.
l-orizzont says some road works at the Cospicua Dock One project have to be redone because of shabby workmanship.
The overseas press
President Obama says he has drawn up new guidelines on the controversial use of unmanned aircraft to hit militant targets abroad. Fox News says he stressed the so-called ???drones??? should be used only when faced by imminent threats and reports was near certainty that no civilians would be affected. Obama also outlined measures aimed at closing centre in Guantanamo.

								The EU anti-fraud agency is confident none of its actions were illegal when it investigated former Health Commissioner John Dalli.
???We have done a legality check on the points raised by the supervisory committee [the agency OLAF???s watchdog] and we are pretty confident we have done nothing that is not according to law ...,??? agency chief Giovanni Kessler said.
???But if anyone of the people concerned feels aggrieved they can take us to court. Mr Dalli has raised one point, we will see,??? Mr Kessler said.
He was speaking at a press briefing in Brussels yesterday where he presented the agency???s annual report for 2012.

The reaction comes after Green MEPs Bart Staes and Jos?? Bov?? leaked to the media in Malta a copy of an internal opinion by the supervisory committee, which questioned the legality of some of OLAF???s actions during the investigation involving John Dalli.
Most of the questions raised actually concern Silvio Zammit, Mr Dalli???s former canvasser, who has so far been the only person charged in connection with the investigation.
He is denying charges of trading in influence and bribery for allegedly asking tobacco firm Swedish Match for ???60 million in return for lifting a ban on...				]]></description>

The 116th and bottom-placed car was the Chevrolet Spark, with the Alfa Romeo Mito in 115th place and the Fiat Grande Punto/Evo 114th.

Topping the company list was Jaguar, followed in second place by Lexus, with Honda third, Skoda fourth and Mercedes-Benz fifth.
Bottom of the 27-company list was Chevrolet, with Alfa Romeo 26th and Mitsubishi 25th.

								A bridge over the Skagit River at Mount Vernon, Washington state, collapsed early today, hurling vehicles and people into the water.
Trooper Mark Francis of the Washington State Patrol said the four-lane Interstate 5 bridge collapsed at about 7pm local time.
He said he did not know how many people were in the water whether there were any injuries or deaths, or what caused the collapse.
A Skagit Valley Herald reporter at the scene said a sheriff's office rescue boat had arrived and rescue crews were looking for people in the water.
The reporter saw one person sitting on top of one vehicle in the water and a second vehicle in the water.
The collapse comes at the start of one of the country's busiest holiday weekends of the year.
The highway is the main one linking Seattle and Vancouver with other cities up and down the US Northwest.				]]></description>

								The Cannes film festival was hit by a second jewellry heist yesterday after a diamond necklace worth $2.6 million USD (2 million euros) disappeared during a star-studded party, according to upmarket jeweller De Grisogono.
The necklace was part of the company's 20th anniversary collection paraded by 20 models at a glitzy event earlier this week.
Sharon Stone, Leonardo DiCaprio and Paris Hilton were among the guests.
Fawaz Gruosi, the founder of the Swiss jewelry house, said the firm's staff, 80 bodyguards, local police and hotel security had been on duty but when the final check was conducted at the end of the night the long-stranded diamond necklace was missing.
Another Swiss jeweller, Chopard, had gems worth $1.4 million (USD) stolen in the first week of the 12-day festival on the glamorous French Riviera.				]]></description>

Claire Bartlett, 50, of Newport, South Wales, does the dishes, dusts and even shines the windows in a deep slumber. The odd habit started last October but because she does such a good job neither she nor her husband Crispin, 63, want to find a cure.

Fifteen minutes out of London a technical fault forced the royal helicopter to urgently divert to a nearby aerodrome in Buckinghamshire. Prince Charles and Camilla were flying to Wales for a day-long tour to Hay. ???It was quite a hairy experience,??? a source close to the palace added.
Despite the unscheduled stop the royal couple transferred to cars and continued on to Hay-on-Wye by road. They finally arrived close to three hours...				]]></description>

								??
An 80-year-old Japanese mountain climber, who has had four heart surgeries, reached the top of Mount Everest yesterday, becoming the oldest person to conquer the world???s highest mountain.
Yuichiro Miura, who took the standard southeast ridge route pioneered by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay 60 years ago, reached the top of the 8,848-metre mountain at roughly 9.00am local time (0300 GMT). He was accompanied by three other Japanese, including his son, and six Nepali sherpas.
???It feels great,??? he told family members and supporters gathered in Tokyo by satellite phone from the summit.
Miura, who first climbed Everest in 2003 and repeated the feat five years later, takes the oldest climber record from Nepal???s Min Bahadur Sherchan, who reached the summit at the age of 76 in 2008.
Sherchan plans to climb again to the summit this week, so Miura???s record may be short-lived.
???The record is not so important to me,??? Miura told Reuters in April, before setting off for Everest. ???It is important to get to the top.???
Miura???s ascent had been watched closely in Japan, with daily broadcasts of phone calls and photographs from the climb ??? including one night when he and his fellow climbers...				]]></description>

								Royal???s phone calls were monitored as he wrestled with decision as to whether he should give up his throne or marry the woman he loved
Edward VIII was secretly bugged during the final days before his abdication on the order of his own ministers, according to official files made public yesterday.
Papers held secret in the Cabinet Office for more than seven decades show that Home Secretary Sir John Simon instructed the General Post Office (GPO) covertly to monitor the King???s telephone calls.
The action suggests an extraordinary breakdown of trust between Edward and his ministers as he wrestled with his decision as to whether he should give up his throne or marry the woman he loved.
In December 1936, the crisis was coming to a head. The previous month, the new King, who had not yet been crowned, informed Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin that he intended to marry his mistress, American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

								Fish oil capsules might help in the fight against diabetes, according to research.
A study has shown that the widely-used supplements, also known as omega 3 fatty acids, give a modest boost to levels of a hormone known as adiponectin in the bloodstream.
The hormone helps the body regulate glucose and control inflammation.
Long-term studies have also shown higher levels of adiponectin are associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
Research accepted for publication in the Endocrine Society???s Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism analysed the findings from 14 clinical trials.
In the trials, 682 subjects were treated with fish oil, and 641 were given placebos ??? most commonly olive and sunflower oils.
The results showed that the effect of fish oil on adiponectin levels differed ???substantially??? across the trials, suggesting that the supplements could have a stronger influence on some populations and a weaker effect on others, according to the authors.
Study lead author Jason Wu, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said: ???By reviewing evidence from existing randomised clinical trials, we found that fish oil supplementation caused modest increases in...				]]></description>

								Electric lights, including thoseilluminating laptop computers, smartphones and tablets, often play a key role in causing people to sleep badly, a leading expert has said.
Artificial lights disrupt the body???s natural rhythm, affect chemicals in the brain and drive people to use stimulants like caffeine to stay awake longer, according to Harvard academic professor Charles Czeisler.
Writing in the journal Nature, the professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School called for research to help develop ???behavioural and technical??? ways of counteracting the ill effects of artificial light on modern sleeping patterns.
The decline in the number of hours slept per night is affecting public health, including a greater risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression and stroke in adults and concentration problems in children, he said.
While all electric light affected ???circadian rhythms??? ??? the natural body clock ??? and sleep, night-time exposure to LED lights like those in phones and computers was ???typically more disruptive??? than standard electric light bulbs, he said.
???There are many reasons why people get insufficient sleep in our 24/7 society, from early starts at work or school,...				]]></description>

								The President of El Salvador met Pope Francis yesterday to urge his fellow Latin American to put Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was murdered by a right-wing death squad in 1980, on the road to Roman Catholic sainthood.
The sainthood process for Archbishop Romero was effectively stalled under former Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI because they saw him as too close to Liberation Theology, a radical movement which emphasised helping the poor and opposing injustice.
President Mauricio Funes said before leaving for Rome the main purpose of his visit was to appeal to the Pope to move forward with Archbishop Romero???s beatification, the penultimate step before sainthood.
Romero, the Archbishop of San Salvador, was shot dead on March 24, 1980, as he celebrated Mass in a hospital chapel. He had often denounced repression and poverty in his weekly homilies.
The murder was one of the most shocking of the long conflict between a series of US-backed governments and leftist rebels in which thousands of people were killed by right-wing and military death squads.
No one was ever brought to justice for the murder although former army major Roberto D???Aubisson, who died in 1992, is generally...				]]></description>

								IMF chief Christine Lagarde was questioned in court by French magistrates yesterday over her role in a ???285-million arbitration payment made to a supporter of former president Nicolas Sarkozy.
Lagarde risks being placed under formal investigation at the hearing for her 2007 decision as Sarkozy???s finance minister to use arbitration to settle a long-running court battle between the state and high-profile businessman Bernard Tapie.
Under French law, that step would mean there exists ???serious or consistent evidence??? pointing to probable implication of a suspect in a crime. It is one step closer to trial.
Such a move could prove uncomfortable for the International Monetary Fund, whose former head, Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn, quit in 2011 over a sex assault scandal, and for a woman rated the most influential in France by Slate magazine.
The case goes back to 1993 when Tapie, a colourful and controversial character in the French business and sports world, sued the state for compensation after selling his stake in sports company Adidas to then state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.
Also a one-time Socialist minister who later supported the conservative Sarkozy, Tapie said the bank...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								The Cannes film festival was hit by a second jewellery heist yesterday after a diamond necklace worth two million euros disappeared during a star-studded party, according to upmarket jeweller De Grisogono.
Fawaz Gruosi, the founder of the Swiss firm, said the necklace was part of the company???s 20th anniversary collection paraded by 20 models at the glitzy event at the Hotel Du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes outside Cannes on Tuesday night. Sharon Stone and Paris Hilton were among the guests.
Gruosi said 80 bodyguards, local police, hotel security, and De Grisogono staff had been on duty but when the final check was conducted at the end of the night the long-stranded diamond necklace was missing.
???We don???t know exactly what happened... it was one of the most beautiful items we had,??? Gruosi told Reuters TV.
No one from the local police was immediately available to comment.
Another Swiss jeweller, Chopard, had gems worth ???1,081,000 stolen in the first week of the 12-day festival on the glamorous French Riviera, which attracts thousands of actors, filmmakers and journalists.
Police said the Chopard jewellery, intended to adorn movie stars at the festival, had been in the safe of a room at...				]]></description>

								Apple has operated almost tax-free in Ireland since 1980, welcomed by a government keen to bring jobs to what was then one of Europe???s poorest countries, former company executives and Irish officials have said.
Chief executive Tim Cook faced criticism from a Senate subcommittee in Washington on Tuesday over the iPad and iPhone maker???s tax practices, which had been shrouded from full view behind secretive tax-exempt Irish-based corporate entities.
Apple, one of Ireland???s top multinational employers, denied avoiding billions of dollars in US taxes and said its arrangements helped fund research jobs in the United States.
The committee revealed that Apple???s Irish companies, some of which are not tax resident in any jurisdiction, allowed the group to pay no tax on much of its overseas earnings in recent years.
Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the subcommittee, said Apple had sought ???the Holy Grail of tax avoidance???.
A former company executive and Irish officials said the almost tax-free status dates all the way back to Apple???s arrival in County Cork 32 years ago.
Apple must have seemed attractive to Ireland and to Cork. Amid a generally moribund Irish economy, Cork had been hard hit by...				]]></description>
