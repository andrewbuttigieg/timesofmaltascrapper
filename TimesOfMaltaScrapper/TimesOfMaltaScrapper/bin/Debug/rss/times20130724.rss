								Enemalta???s fuel purchasing was ???totally the domain of the chairman???, former members of the Fuel Procurement Committee said yesterday following last week???s damning report by the Auditor General.
???It was no secret at Enemalta that the fuel procurement process was the chairman???s domain,??? one former committee member told Times of Malta on condition of anonymity.
???It is true that the bids received used to be decided by us (the committee) but it was a chairman-driven initiative. It was the chairman who used to receive the bids on his own e-mail address and it was his office that used to call the shots, even about when the committee would meet to make decisions.???

In its report last week, the National Audit Office slammed Enemalta???s fuel procurement practices between 2008 and 2010, when Alex Tranter was chairman of the corporation.
The report raised serious questions about lack of policy, inexplicable decisions and lack of proper records showing who took decisions. The police have launched an investigation following a Government request.
Speaking to this newspaper anonymously yesterday, former members of the committee confirmed that, until Tonio Fenech became politically responsible for...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								A fire has broken out on a blown-out gas well in the Gulf of Mexico.
Natural gas has been spewing out of control from the well after the blowout forced the evacuation of 44 workers on a drilling rig about 55 miles off the Louisiana coast, authorities said.
Eileen Angelico of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) confirmed that the evacuated rig had caught fire, but there were no reports of injuries.
Ms Angelico said it was not clear what caused the gas to ignite, and it was not known what efforts to extinguish the blaze were being made.
Personnel from Wild Well Control are at the site to develop a plan to shut down the flow of gas, said Jim Noe, executive vice president of Hercules Offshore, owner of the drilling rig where the blowout occurred.
Mr Noe stressed that gas, not oil, was flowing from the well. He said it is an important distinction because gas wells in relatively shallow areas - this one was in 154ft of water - sometimes tend to clog with sand, effectively snuffing themselves out. "That is a distinct possibility at this point," he said. "But until we have our Wild Well Control personnel on the rig, we won't know much more."

								The father of Matthew Zahra (pictured), who was reported missing a year ago, is glad to finally know what happened to his son as, no matter how painful the truth is, the family can now have closure.
???For the past year we were left questioning what happened to my son. We wanted to find him alive.
???Not knowing where he was hurt and knowing what happened also hurts. It???s not a nice death. We can???t bring him back,??? Mr Zahra???s father, Vincent, told Times of Malta.
His family are waiting for the results of DNA tests on human remains found in the Qajjenza field on Thursday while police investigate the double murder of Mario Camilleri and his son Mario Jr, found in the same field.
???At least, if it turns out to be him, we can give him a proper burial,??? Mr Zahra said.
Matthew Zahra, 27, was reported missing on the evening of August 15 last year. He lived in Valletta with his partner Krystle Grixti and their three children.
He left home at 7am and, after not seeing or hearing from him all day, the family decided to file a police report at about 8pm. He was last seen in Valletta and his car was found in Marsaxlokk.				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Violence has broken out in Bulgaria as police tried to evacuate politicians trapped inside parliament by demonstrators.
Anti-government protests have been going on for 40 days in the capital Sofia, and escalated as several hundred protesters hemmed the officials inside parliament in a bid to oust the left-leaning government.
A bus arrived to escort the officials out but protesters refused to let it leave, forming a human chain and hurling stones at it.
Demonstrators shouted "Murderers" as dozens of police in riot gear pushed and clubbed them to try to clear a path for the bus. Four people were injured included some with head injuries.
A total of 109 people - including three ministers, 30 MPs, journalists and parliament staff remain trapped inside the building, according to National TV which broadcast the events live.
Protesters said they are determined to continue with the blockade of the building until their demands are met.
President Rosen Plevneliev issued a statement calling on the protesters to keep the demonstrations "peaceful and civilised".
"For the first time since the start of the protests we have now witnessed tension and attempts for provocation," Mr Plevneliev said,...				]]></description>

								The following are the top stories in the national and international press today.
All national newspapers today report about the arraignments of three men - two charged with the murder of Matthew Zahra in August last and one with last Wednesday???s double murder of a drug trafficker and his 21-year-old son.
Times of Malta says that Jason Galea, the man charged with killing a father and son found in a field last Wednesday was accused again yesterday of murdering a third person who went missing last August. In another story it quotes former members of the Fuel Procurement Committee saying that Enemalta???s fuel purchasing was totally the domain of the chairman.
L-Orizzont says that the body of murdered Mario Camilleri Snr was exhumed for more forensic tests. In another story it refers to the European Court of Human Rights judgments which ordered Malta to pay two irregular immigrants a total of ???60,000 for breaching their human rights.
The Malta Independent also leads with the ECHR judgments. 
In-Nazzjon quotes Minister Marie Louise Coleiro Preca saying she believed the declaration of assets as submitted by her colleagues.

								The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge proudly showed the world their baby son, a future king, before taking him home tonight.
William and Kate began their new lives as parents, cradling their baby prince and posing for pictures on the steps of the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London.
The Duchess held her son first and the couple looked relaxed and smiled broadly as the world's media captured the moment.
William later held his son and walked forward with his wife to answer a few questions. He began by joking: "He's got a good pair of lungs on him, that's for sure. He's a big boy, he's quite heavy. We are still working on a name so we will have that as soon as we can."
He added: "It's the first time we have seen him really so we are having a proper chance to catch up."
The Duchess, who still had a bump under her summer dress, said: "It's very emotional, it's such a special time. I think any parent will know what this feeling feels like."
Her husband agreed: "It's very special."
He added: "I'll remind him of his tardiness when he's a bit older. I know how long you've all been standing here so hopefully the hospital and you guys can all go back to normal now and we can go and look...				]]></description>

								No reports have yet been received by the Foreign Ministry of any Maltese injured in a blast in Tripoli, a spokesman said this afternoon.
A rocket-propelled grenade struck a residential building near a tower housing several foreign embassies and a major hotel in the Libyan capital, witnesses and a security source said
There were no reported injuries in the incident in which a balcony of a residential block was charred and holed, a Reuters reporter on the scene said. A security source said the rocket was launched from car which burst into flames.
There has been a spate of bombings in recent months in Libya - in April the French embassy in Tripoli was bombed, while in the volatile eastern city of Benghazi, four Americans - including the ambassador - were killed on September 11 last year.
The explosion occurred in the car park of a residential compound next to Tripoli Towers, where the British and Canadian embassies as well as several foreign airlines and other companies are based.
It was also about a kilometre away from Corintha's Bab Africa Hotel, which is used by foreign businessmen and government officials.
The security source did not rule out that the rocket may have been...				]]></description>

								Three cheeky baby meerkats have ventured out into their enclosure for the first time.
Keepers at Bristol Zoo Gardens welcomed the triplets on June 21, when they were born to mother Babushka.
Babushka has plenty of experience to manage the demanding brood, as they are her 11th litter.
The triplets are currently too young to be sexed so have not yet been named.
Lynsey Bugg, assistant curator of mammals at Bristol Zoo, said: "The triplets have spent their first few weeks safely snuggled up with mum or another designated 'babysitter', most often somewhere quiet like a nest box or in the tunnel system of their enclosure.
"In the wild pups would not emerge from a burrow until they were two to three weeks old.
"Mum will feed them frequently but the whole group should help to keep them safe and warm and they are commonly found at the bottom of a huddle."
Meerkats usually have between one and five pups per litter but three or four is average.
The new arrivals bring the number of meerkats at the zoo to 18.				]]></description>

The new categories are:
???U??? - universal - suitable for all.

								Home Affairs Minister Manuel Mallia said this evening his failure to declare his earnings last year in the ministerial declaration of assets was due to a misunderstanding.
He said he had been told that since he had not been a Member of Parliament last year he did not have to include last year???s income.
However, since the controversy erupted he asked for the record to be amended, he said, adding that last year he earned ???137,000.
Asked about the ???500,000 in cash he declared he had, the minister said this was because he had disposed of some property he had owned.
The minister was speaking after he presided over a press conference at the Corradino Correctional Facilities, where an EU funded training programme was launched.
The programme was piloted by the Paola council and will see some 180 inmates applying for courses with MCAST.
The courses will be held at the CCF and the idea is to enable inmates to integrate back into the labour market after they leave prison.
Dr Mallia siad it was the government commitment to help in the reform of prisoners

Photo: Darrin Zammit Lupi" title="Caravan owners argued they had never claimed legal title to land at Little Armier. Photo: Darrin Zammit Lupi" /></p>
								Caravan owners who contested an eviction order and lost are insisting that whether they had legal title was ???irrelevant??? to their case.
The 12 caravan owners and Armier Developments Ltd, a company made up of boathouse owners, have appealed against the court sentence that threw out their claims.
Last month Mr Justice Anthony Ellul ruled that the controversial caravans in Little Armier bay had no legal title and structures on publicly owned property along the shore were illegal.
It was inconceivable, the judge had insisted, that a letter handed to the boathouse owners by the Government could be construed as a binding contract allowing people who had usurped public land to continue occupying it.
The caravan owners contended that the crux of the court case should not have been whether or not they had legal title over the land in question because they had never claimed legal title.
In the appeal filed by lawyers Ian Refalo and Sarah Grech, the owners argued that the case revolved around an agreement they had with the Government on use of the land in the area.
They also contested the court???s ruling that there was no written and signed agreement between the parties. ???An agreement need...				]]></description>

								The government was considering all its legal options following the European Court of Human Right judgments given today, in the cases of Aden Ahmed and Suso Musa against Malta.
The Court found the government in breach of human rights and ordered it to pay Ms Ahmed a total of?????33,000 and Mr Musa a total of?????27,000.
In a statement, the Home Affairs Ministry said the situation it inherited in the sector was a difficult one.
It said it was sad to note that the European Court decided against Malta because of the situation under the previous government.
While the government was to continue insisting that the country could not keep up with the massive influx of irregular migrants, it would still be working to improve detention conditions so that mistakes of the past would not to be repeated, it said.
The ministry said this,??however, could not be done if the government was left on its own so it was making its voice heard with European politicians and institutions.
The government wanted a national political consensus on the matter, particularly from the people who had been in the government when the situations which led to the European Court???s condemnation today took place.				]]></description>

								A disability foundation will be monitoring air quality at its Marsascala premises after a neighbouring recycling plant developed a fault and started burning an acidic gas.
Inspire appointed its own expert after the Government acted on recommendations to close a family park ??? sandwiched between the recycling plant and the foundation ??? until the recycling plant fault is repaired.
Inspire chief executive Nathan Farrugia said it was assured by the Environment Ministry and the Office of the Prime Minister over the weekend that emission levels from the recycling plant chimney were ???well below??? the safety margins set by the EU.
???We immediately contacted the authorities because of concerns about the health of our employees, summer school students and regulars who avail themselves of our services,??? Mr Farrugia said.

He added that, as a precaution, Inspire appointed an independent university professor to monitor air quality at the premises over a period of days.
The foundation has also asked to see the technical details of the Government-commissioned report because the experts who drew it up also sampled air quality at the site.
???We were told there is nothing to be alarmed about and it...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								China has banned the construction of government buildings for five years as another step in a frugality drive that aims to address public anger at corruption.
The general offices of the Communist Party's central committee and the State Council - China's Cabinet - jointly issued the directive.
Across China, grand government buildings with oversized offices and fancy lighting including chandeliers have mushroomed in many cities. They are often among the most impressive in their own towns, drawing disapproval from the public.
President Xi Jinping has spearheaded a campaign to cut through pomp, formality and waste among senior officials that have alienated many ordinary citizens.
This year, upmarket restaurants have reported a downturn in business as government departments and state-owned companies cancelled banquets.
The directive orders an "across-the-board halt" to construction of official buildings, and "glitzy" structures built as training centres, hotels or government motels. Some government agencies have built such buildings in seaside resorts and other scenic spots as a perk for their officials and employees who can stay for free or at deeply discounted prices. They sometimes...				]]></description>

								More than 80 per cent of the Maltese feel ???European??? and want to know more about their rights, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey results published today.
The EU-average is six out of 10 citizens, but less than half (46 per cent) know what these rights are.
The results also show that Europeans see their rights as EU citizens as the most positive result of membership ??? almost six in 10 people identify the free movement of people, goods and services as the EU's most positive result.
Despite the crisis, those saying they are optimistic about the EU's future outnumber those who say they are pessimistic in 19 out of 28 countries.
Pessimism about the impact of the crisis on jobs appears to be receding.
Almost seven in 10 Europeans (67 per cent), with a majority in all member states, say that the EU's voice counts in the world.
An absolute majority (51 per cent) of Europeans are in favour of the euro, with those living within the euro area supporting the single currency with a two-thirds majority (62 per cent).
This support is at or near its strongest (between 68 and 77 per cent) in four out of the last five countries to join the euro area - Estonia, Malta, Slovenia and...				]]></description>

								Public awareness on the dangers of hepatitis is particularly important in summer?? because of the increased vulnerability to infection through travelling and contact with foreign nationals, according to Health Minister Godfrey Farrugia.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of World Hepatitis Day, being celebrated this Sunday, Dr Farrugia said:
???This time of year is probably the most crucial. Many people travel abroad to exotic countries in the summer and are at an increased risk,??? Dr Farrugia said.
Hepatitis B and C are viral infections that cause inflammation and swelling of the liver.
While they are both transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, hepatitis B is up to 100 times more infectious than HIV.
Hepatitis C is less easily passed on but can be the most damaging form of the disease.
Discussing the measures employed to counter the spread of the virus Dr Farrugia highlighted the effectiveness of the hepatitis B vaccine, which is provided freely to children, missionary workers, health professionals and other employees deemed to be at risk of infection, such as drainage department employees.
Between one and two per cent of the Maltese population are currently infected...				]]></description>

First to be charged was 41-year-old George Galea, a security guard from St Julian's, who pleaded not guilty to shooting Mr Camilleri Snr and stabbing Mr Camilleri Jnr. He did not request bail and was remanded in custody.

Police Inspectors Chris Pullicino, Fabian Fleri, Michael Mallia and Louise Calleja prosecuted.
Lawyers Giannella de Marco and Gianluca Caruana Curran appeared for Mr Galea.
Mr Galea's step-brother Ronald Urry, 49, of Paola and Jason Galea, 39, of Birzebbuga were then charged with Matthew Zahra's murder.
