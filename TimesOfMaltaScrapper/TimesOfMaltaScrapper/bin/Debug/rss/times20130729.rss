								A labour rights group has accused a supplier of Apple in China of misconduct including withholding employees' pay and environmental violations.
The report by China Labour Watch said it found violations of the law and of Apple's pledges about working conditions at facilities operated by Pegatron, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturing company.
Apple said in a statement it was "committed to providing safe and fair working conditions" and would investigate the claims.
Pegatron, in a separate statement, also promised to investigate.
Apple said an investigator for the company confirmed one accusation by China Labour Watch - that Pegatron was holding the identity cards of some workers - and ordered the company to stop.				]]></description>

								Malta's consuls overseas are being requested to propose at least one project a year aimed at bringing investment to Malta and exploring opportunities.
Addressing the consuls at Smart City this morning, where they gathered for their biennial conference, Foreign Minister George Vella said the advancement of Malta???s economic and cultural interests overseas was topmost of the Government's agenda.
"This Government is committed to ensuring that we utilise our extensive diplomatic reach to the maximum of its potential. We are however realistic and have our feet firmly on the ground. We cannot wait for investment to come to our shores.
"Now, like never before we need to extend our reach and use all the means at our disposal in order to continue to attract high quality foreign direct investment to our islands. This is our focus and this will be the main focus of my Ministry during this legislature."
Dr Vella told the consults the government looked at them to enhance Malta's reputation in several areas, including the financial services, maritime and aviation sectors.

								After sharing the story of how he survived three brain surgeries, 15-year-old Jacob Cachia is glad to see that the number of people joining his Facebook group, Survivors Malta, is on the rise.
The closed group managed to attract more than 100 members so far and Jacob and his mother, Sarah, are very pleased, especially as they know it will take time for people to join and speak about a difficult time in their lives.
???The group is still in its early days but when the members begin to open up and find the courage to share their stories it will be both beneficial to themselves, to other members and to future members who will have a place they can turn to for inspiration in their time of need... a place we never had,??? Ms Cachia said a week after her son???s story was published in The Sunday Times of Malta.
Jacob was studying for his O level examinations in January when he started suffering bad headaches.
He was taken to hospital, diagnosed with sinusitis and admitted to the ENT ward.
On the fifth day, Jacob had a seizure. An MRI revealed that the right side of his brain was full of pus. Bacteria had entered his brain through the sinuses.
He had an operation that included removing part of...				]]></description>

								The first breeding of the little ringed plover at the Salina Salt Pans has been recorded by members of the Aquilarus Bird Study Group.
The adult birds and three chicks were first sighted on July 7.
In the Maltese Islands, the little ringed plover is a common passage migrant occurring both in spring, from early March to late May, and in autumn, from July to early November.
It is also a localised breeding bird in small numbers.
The species first bred in the Maltese islands in 1995 at the Ghadira Nature Reserve and although one to six pairs have nested since, this has, until now, been confined to the Mellieha reserve, the latter offering the ideal conditions and even more important, a protective environment.
With major works going on to rehabilitate the Salina salt pans, this nesting record is even more surprising considering the amount of disturbance going on.
Subsequent visits showed that the little ringed plover family was faring well and all three chicks fledged successfully.
???This is an indication of the potential of the Salina Salt Pans, once the area is fully rehabilitated to its former status.
???If properly managed, the Salina area can be transformed into a potential Ramsar...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								The head of the Mellieha Primary School is being retained, according to Education Minister Evarist Bartolo.
Yesterday, a petition was launched calling on education authoroities to keep Mary Rose Mercieca as head teacher.
The petition says that Ms Mercieca has been heading the school for the past academic year (in an acting position) but has just been informed she will not remain head.
Mr Bartolo said on facebook this morning he wanted to put parents??? and teachers??? minds at rest that Ms Mercieca would continue leading the school.
He thanked teachers and parents who contacted him requesting that she and Safi head Ms Joahanna Cauchi, be retained in their post. Ms Cauchi will also be keeping her post, he said.
In a letter to the minister the Mellieha parents said the school community had ???thrived and flourished??? during Ms Mercieca???s one year of leadership.				]]></description>

								A drug that could make life easier for some multiple sclerosis (MS) sufferers has been approved for the health service list but no funds have yet been allocated.
The ground-breaking drug is the first pill-based medicine that helps reduce relapses for some adults who have highly active MS.
The Novartis-produced Gilenya (fingolimod) was approved by the European Commission in 2011.
According to the drug company, switching to Gilenya from an injected equivalent resulted in almost 50 per cent more patients being free of symptoms.
It is available in hospitals or reimbursed by the Government in 19 EU countries.
A Health Ministry spokesman said that the necessary procedures for introducing this treatment in the Government Formulary List were in process.
???This medicine has been approved for procurement, however, no funds have been allocated. In the meantime, patients are being assisted through the Malta Community Chest Fund.???
The ministry was also asked about a drug in pill form that helps control Type 2 diabetes and sees patients doing away with invasive insulin injections.
A patient who spoke to the newspaper said he was intolerant to the medication available on the Government Formulary...				]]></description>

								Officers in Ecuador's armed forces could be about to lose their privileges and perks.
President Rafael Correa has called for officers to be stripped of separate dining facilities and meals. In a speech marking Navy Day, he called such practices anachronistic, hateful vestiges of inequality. The populist leftist leader also criticised "exclusive" clubs for military officers paid for with taxpayer dollars.
While clubs and recreational facilities for officers are better appointed in Ecuador than those for enlisted personnel, service people do pay fees to help maintain them.				]]></description>

								Enemalta???s former chief financial officer has admitted that hand??written papers shown in a damning audit report as minutes were his, but claimed they were just his own working notes.
Pippo Pandolfino lambasted the conclusions released earlier this month by Auditor General Anthony Mifsud and said neither he nor any of the former members of the committee were interviewed by the National Audit Office.
???Had they done so, perhaps the misunderstandings on their part would have been avoided much earlier,??? Mr Pandolfino told Times of Malta.

Mr Pandolfino attended all meetings of the corporation???s Fuel Procurement Committee (FPC) between 2004 and 2009. The NAO report was very critical of the way the FPC used to conduct its business between 2008 and 2010 and underlined the fact that the minutes of the meetings at the time ???lacked the most rudi??mentary level of detail and bore no information relating to meeting discussions and the decision-making process???.
In its report, the NAO criticised the practices adopted by the FPC raising serious questions about lack of record keeping, proper testing for inferior quality fuel, and lack of proper records on who took decisions.

								The following are the top stories in the national and international press today.
In Times of Malta,??Enemalta???s former chief financial officer Pippo Pandolfino admits that handwritten papers shown in a damning audit report by the Auditor General as minutes were his, but claimed they were just his own working notes. In another story it says political leaders agreed that??Malta???s 18-month mandatory detention should remain unchanged despite criticism by the European Court of Human Rights.
The Malta Independent says that Nationalist MP Chris Fearne is to propose a Private Member's Bill after the summer recess to ban female genital mutilation.
L-Orizzont says that the British government linked release of Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi to an arms-export deal with Libya, according to an e-mail written by former British High Commissioner to Malta Vincent Dean when he was serving in Libya.
In-Nazzjon quotes PN leader Simon Busuttil saying that Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had ruined Malta's reputation internationally with his push-back of irregular immigrant threats.

								The Italian coastguard has rescued 22 migrants from a boat which sank off the coast of Libya but more than 30 are still missing at sea, ANSA news agency said.
The coastguard said in total it had rescued more than 500 people trying to reach Europe over the weekend. Most are from sub-Saharan Africa and departed from the Libyan coast.
A coastguard spokesman confirmed the rescue of 22 people from the sinking on Friday but could not confirm survivors' accounts, reported by ANSA, that 31 were still missing and feared to have persihed.
Rescuers were still searching for any survivors, he said.
North Africa is a launch-point for migration to southern Europe, with Italy the main destination. Thousands of people have been killed attempting the dangerous crossing in overcrowded and frequently unsafe boats.
Those rescued over the weekend have been taken to reception centres on Sicily or the island of Lampedusa, the spokesman said.
Pope Francis this month visited Lampedusa to commemorate those who have died trying to reach Europe.
This month was a record month for irregular migrant arrivals in Malta with 880 reaching the islands so far.				]]></description>

								A tour bus filled with Italians returning home after an excursion plunged off a highway into a ravine in southern Italy after it had smashed into several cars that were slowed by heavy traffic, killing at least 37 people, said police and rescuers.
Flashing signs near Avellino, outside Naples, had warned of slow traffic ahead along a stretch of the A116 autostrada, a major highway crossing southern Italy, before the crash occurred on Sunday night, said highway police and officials speaking on state radio. They said the bus driver, for reasons not yet determined, appeared to have lost control of his vehicle.
Hours after the crash, firefighters said that they had extracted 37 bodies - most of the dead were found inside the mangled bus, which lay on its side, while a few of the victims were pulled out from underneath the wreckage, state radio and the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
The radio report said 11 people were taken to hospital with injuries, two of them in very critical condition. It was not immediately known if there were other survivors or any missing.

								Two large explosions hit courthouses in the Libyan city of Benghazi, leaving part of one of the buildings a pile of rubble, two security officials said.
An official in Benghazi said 10 people were wounded, two seriously, in the explosion outside one courthouse. Video posted by residents online showed several vehicles destroyed by that explosion. The video also showed residents standing in a crater in the ground outside the building.
Another courthouse in the eastern part of the city was also hit, said a security official in the capital, Tripoli.
The courthouse in the north of Benghazi was the site of the first protests against dictator Muammar Gaddafi in early 2011 that led to his removal. It continues to be a hub for protests.
The explosion erupted just before a planned protest outside one of the buildings to mark the second anniversary of the death of Gen Abdul Fattah Younis, a former Gaddafi security minister who defected from the regime to join the rebels fighting him. He was killed in July 2011 by his comrades while in custody after he was arrested on suspicion of treason.
Security officials said police are investigating if the explosions were the result of bombs.

								Pope Francis's historic trip to his home continent ended yesterday after a marathon week-long visit to Brazil that drew millions of people on to the sands of Rio de Janeiro's iconic Copacabana beach and appeared to reinvigorate the clergy and faithful alike in the world's largest Catholic country.
Dignitaries including Brazilian vice president Michel Temer turned out at Rio's Antonio Carlos Jobim international airport to bid farewell to the Argentine-born pontiff after a visit marked by big moments. They included a visit to a vast church dedicated to Brazil's patron saint, a rainy walk through one of Rio's dangerous slums and a papal Mass that was one of the biggest in recent history.
Speaking from a white stage on the sands of Copacabana, Pope??Francis urged a crowd estimated at three million people to go out and spread their faith "to the fringes of society, even to those who seem farthest away, most indifferent".
"The church needs you, your enthusiasm, your creativity and the joy that is so characteristic of you!" he said to applause in his final homily of World Youth Day festivities.
Later, he issued a more pointed message to the region's bishops, telling them to better look...				]]></description>

								The success of British Prime Minister David Cameron???s flagship immigration policy was called into serious question yesterday, dealing him a potential blow ahead of 2015 elections by playing into the hands of a populist anti-immigration party.
A report by lawmakers from across the political spectrum concluded that Britain???s migration statistics were grossly unreliable and ???not fit??? for purpose, undermining the credibility of Cameron???s assertions about the issue.
Immigration is a hot button issue in Britain, where Cameron is trying to stop an exodus of voters to the UK Independence Party (UKIP) before a parliamentary election in two years??? time, and polls show the issue is one that worries voters the most.
Concerns have been fuelled by warnings in the right-leaning press about ???hordes??? of Romanians and Bulgarians moving to Britain next year when EU freedom of movement restrictions lapse, at a time when Britons face rising competition for jobs.
To compound Cameron???s problems on immigration, a government pilot scheme that involves vans driving around London with billboards telling illegal immigrants to ???go home or face arrest??? has angered his junior coalition partner, the Liberal...				]]></description>

								Some of Italy???s top politicians this weekend rallied behind the country???s first black minister, a target of racist slurs since her appointment in April, after a spectator threw bananas at her while she was making a speech.
Integration Minister Cecile Kyenge, who is originally from Democratic Rep-ublic of Congo, was appearing at a political rally in Cervia in central Italy on Friday, when someone in the audience threw bananas towards the stage, narrowly missing it.
Kyenge has faced almost daily racial slurs and threats since joining the government. Earlier this month a senator from the anti-immigration Northern League party likened her to an orangutan.
Last month, a local Northern League councillor said Kyenge should be raped so she understands how victims of crimes committed by immigrants feel.
The councillor has received a suspended jail sentence and a temporary ban from public office.
Shortly before Friday???s incident, members of the far-right Forza Nuova group left mannequins covered in fake blood near the site of the Democratic Party rally in protest against Kyenge???s proposal to make anyone born on Italian soil a citizen.
???Immigration kills,??? was written on leaflets...				]]></description>

								Thousands of supporters of Egypt???s Muslim Brotherhood stood their ground outside a Cairo mosque yesterday a day after at least 72 were gunned down by security forces, braced for a move against them by the army chief behind the overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.
General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi made his first appearance since Saturday???s bloodshed, smiling before TV cameras at a police graduation ceremony. He received a standing ovation and was hailed by Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim as ???Egypt???s devoted son???.
Fawning coverage in the media reflected Sisi???s rising star, in a country ruled by former military officers for six decades before Morsi???s election in 2012.
Saturday???s dawn killings, following a day of rival mass rallies, triggered global anxiety that the Arab world???s most populous and influential country risked broader conflagration.
The Brotherhood accuses the military of turning back the clock on the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak, and demands that Morsi, Egypt???s first freely elected president, be reinstated.
Morsi has been in military detention since his July 3 overthrow and the military-backed interim government has placed him under investigation on...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								The Colombian government and leftist Farc rebels resumed peace negotiations in Havana yesterday after a recess of more than two weeks, during which 19 soldiers and a number of rebels were killed and rural protests left four farmers dead and several police injured.
More than 200,000 people have died and millions have been displaced in fighting since the Farc, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, was founded in 1964 as a communist agrarian re-form movement.
The talks, which began in November, recess every few weeks then resume, even as the longest ??? and last ??? armed conflict in Latin America rages on.
???Many Colombians do not understand why we are in a dialogue when attacks by armed groups continue,??? Colombian former vice president and lead government negotiator, Humberto de la Calle, said before the new round of talks began.
Patience with the Farc, considered a terrorist group by the US and the EU, has deteriorated in recent weeks after an escalation of violence that culminated last weekend in the death of 19 soldiers and the announcement that the guerrillas had kidnapped US citizen Kevin Scott Sutay in June and now wanted to free him.
Fifteen of the soldiers were ambushed by...				]]></description>

								Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said he would not flee Italy and was ready to go to jail rather than face house arrest or community service if a court upholds his conviction for tax fraud this week.
Italy???s highest appeals court will tomorrow hear Berlusconi???s final appeal against a four-year prison sentence and a ban from public office for tax fraud in connection with the purchase of broadcasting rights by his TV network Mediaset.

He told Libero, a newspaper which supports him, that he would never become a fugitive like the late Bettino Craxi, a former prime minister who fled to Tunisia to escape a jail sentence for corruption and spent the last years of his life in exile.
???I will not go into exile, like Bettino Craxi was forced to. I will also not accept being handed over to social services, like a criminal that has to be re-educated,??? he said in comments published yesterday.
If the Court of Cassation rejects Berlusconi???s appeal he could serve only one year of his sentence due to a 2006 amnesty law, and at the age of 76 he would likely be granted house arrest, but he challenged judges to put him behind bars.
???If they convict me ??? if they assume that responsibility ???...				]]></description>
