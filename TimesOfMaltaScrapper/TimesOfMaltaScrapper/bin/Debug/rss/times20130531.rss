			<description><![CDATA[
								Seven people have been killed and others injured after two separate attacks in Iraq.
Police said a bomb left by the side of the road at the Omar mosque in west Baghdad killed four people and injured 11 others as they were walking away after Friday prayers.
Meanwhile, police said that three policemen were killed when gunmen attacked a security checkpoint in the city of Fallujah, a former al-Qaida stronghold 65 kilometers west of Baghdad. Two other policemen were hurt in the attack.
Health workers confirmed the casualties.
In a show of national unity, Shiite and Sunni worshippers held joint prayers on Friday in a Shiite mosque in downtown Baghdad amid tight security measures.
Sunni cleric Khalid al-Mulla urged the government and the Iraqi people to stop the bloodshed by uniting against "the terrorists who want to kill our sons in the name of Islam".
He said: "The blood that is being shed is precious Iraqi blood... so we should say 'Enough' to these killings."				]]></description>

								Anti-capitalist protesters blocked streets leading to the European Central Bank in Germany in protests over austerity cutbacks.
Members of the Blockupy alliance linked arms for several hours on the streets leading to the bank in Frankfurt. Some demonstrators grabbed and shook the metal police barricades surrounding the bank.
Police brought out a truck with a water cannon but it was not used. One officer used pepper spray while being confronted by demonstrators at a barricade.
A spokesman for the ECB said the bank remained in operation. Police said they had assisted some employees in getting to the building.
Blockupy said it wanted to underline what it says is the ECB's role in promoting austerity cutbacks.
Police reported no arrests and estimated the number of demonstrators at between 1,000 and 1,500. Organisers said there were more than 3,000.
After the ECB demonstration, several hundred protesters moved to Deutsche Bank's headquarters.
Spokesman Roland Suess said the demonstration was a success. He said: "We wanted to blockade the ECB and we did that with more than 3,000 people."				]]></description>

								A stray snake found by a man while he was drinking his morning tea could have been living in his wall for 18 months.

The snake has been named Rab after the man who found him and is being cared for at the charity???s Glasgow rehoming centre.
Neighbours in the block of flats lost a snake 18 months ago but have since moved out.				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Protesters have stormed the office of a gold mine in Kyrgyzstan demanding its nationalisation and more social benefits.
About 2,000 people descended on the office of the Kumtor mine operated by Canadian-based firm Centerra Gold in protests that have been going on for several days.
Police arrested 80 protesters on Thursday night after several hundred, some on horseback, entered a power transformer unit and cut off electricity to the mine for several hours.
Centerra says the protests are illegal and that it is working with the government and local authorities to resolve the situation.
Kumtor accounts for about 12% of the economy of the ex-Soviet nation of five million people on China's mountainous western border.				]]></description>

								Riot police used tear gas and pressurized water to disperse people staging a sit-in to prevent the uprooting of trees at a park in Istanbul, Turkey.
Several protesters were injured when a wall they climbed collapsed during a police chase and a prominent journalist was taken to hospital after being hit in the head by a tear gas canister, according to reports.
Police moved in to disperse the crowd on the fourth day of the protest against a government plan to revamp Istanbul's main square, Taksim. Officers then clashed with demonstrators in surrounding areas.
The protesters are demanding that the square's park, Gezi, be protected.
Protesters in Gezi Park were seen holding up a large poster with a caricature depicting Turkish prime minister Recap Tayyip Erdogan as an Ottoman sultan with a caption that read: "The people won't yield to you."
Erdogan dismissed the protesters' demands for the park's protection, saying the government would go ahead with renovation plans "no matter what they do".
The forestry minister said more trees would be planted than those uprooted at Gezi and has defended the government's environmental record.
The raid was the latest in a series of crackdowns on...				]]></description>

								Good Health Sultanas 200gr packs with a best before date of December 30, 2014, have been recalled, the health authorities said.
The recall is because the level of Ochratoxin A found in the packs exceeds that permitted in regulations.
The authorities also said that The British Premium Sausage Co. 454gr frozen beef sausages packed on January 25 and with a best before date of January 2, 2014 were recalled because of undeclared pork traces.				]]></description>

								A woman who was jailed yesterday was released from prison today, after she paid ???7,000.
The woman, Concetta Charles, had failed to procure a girl from Pakistan for would-be adoptive parents.
She had been ordered to refund the money in a civil suit in 2004. Criminal proceedings for misappropriation were then launched and she was convicted and handed an 18-month suspended jail term.
The jail term became effective yesterday after the would-be adoptive parents, Lawrence and Maria-Concetta Grima initiated fresh proceedings where they explained that they had not been given the refund ordered by the court.
Ms Charles was released from prison today after she paid the couple the ???7,000 she owed them.				]]></description>

			<link>http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130531/local/deficit-down.472002</link>
			<description><![CDATA[
								A deficit of ???183 million was recorded in the first four months of this year, down from ???232.2 million in the same period last year, the National Statistics Office said.
It said that an increase of ???79.2 million in recurrent revenue outweighed the added expenditure of
???29.9 million, resulting in a reduction of ???49.2 million in the government deficit.
During January-April, recurrent revenue stood at ???827.8 million, up by 10.6 per cent over last year. This increase was mainly due to higher proceeds from grants (+???47.9 million), income tax (+???39.1 million) and social security (+???10.1 million).
These were partially offset by lower returns from the Central Bank of Malta (-???12 million), customs and excise duties (-???4.9 million) and dividends on investments (-???4.4 million).
Compared to 2012, total expenditure amounted to ???1,010.8 million, up by three per cent, as a result of added outlays on capital and recurrent expenditure.
Recurrent expenditure advanced by ???12.5 million. This was mainly triggered by higher outlays on personal emoluments and contributions to government entities by ???16.5 million and ???1.8 million, respectively.
On the other hand, operational and maintenance expenditure...				]]></description>

								Government is committed to ensure that the retirement age remains 65 and this plan has been communicated to the European Commission.
The Commission recently recommended that Malta addresses the pensions issue, Social Solidarity Minister Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca said.
She said the Government was putting forward other suggestions such as maximising the women's work productivity. There was also the electoral pledge to introduce a third pillar pension and the Government was now studying options.
"If we are pressured I can assure you that funds will not be withdrawn from social sectors such as health and social services," she said.
She was speaking during the bi-annual general conference of the General Workers Union's pensioners association.
The minister said the government was committed to evaluate the current pension system to establish, among other things, if pensions were enough to allow a good quality of life and that they were sustainable. This would be done through consultation, she said. A working group had been set up for this purpose.
She said that 10 years had been wasted in addressing the pension problem and, had this been addressed before, "we would be in a position to...				]]></description>

								An Employment Training Corporation scheme, called community work scheme, is resulting in precarious work, according to GWU general secretary Tony Zarb.
These workers work 30 hours a week within local councils for which they get paid a flat rate of ???25.
The union will be meeting the Government to ensure that this abuse is brought to an end by removing or changing the scheme.
To add insult to injury, he said, if workers refused to work under the scheme they were struck off the unemployment register.
Mr Zarb added that the time had come for a law that specifically tackled precarious employment.				]]></description>

								Xarabank is this evening appealing to television viewers to save a life by donating ???15 which would go towards buying essential malaria medicine for sick people in Tanzania.
The talk show crew visited the country earlier this year taking with them Maltese singer Amber and journalist Keith Demicoli to see for themselves the reality and poverty in the African state.
A programme had then been held and once it was over, producer Peppi Azzopardi received a call for a man who asked to remain unnamed and who donated ???100,000 to the Mission Fund towards a water project.
In this evening???s programme, the Prime Minister, the leader of the Opposition, the Archbishop, the bishops, singer Gianluca and doctor Sr Maria Borda, who has been in Tanzania for the past 27 years, will be answering telephone calls to collect funds.
Mr Azzopardi said that before teaching these people to fend for themselves, they had to be fed, cured of their diseases and educated.
The Mission Fund has built several hospitals and schools in poor countries.
???15 donations can be made by calling 5170 2015, ???25 donations on 5180 2025 and ???4.66 donations on SMS 5061 8071.				]]></description>

								A known criminal suspect was shot dead in Marsa at 11am.
The incident happened at Triq Belt il-Hazna close to the Enemalta Customer Care Office.
It is understood that the victim, Pawlu Degabriele, 48, of Fgura, known as is-Suldat, was at a bar outside the office and was shot, at least twice, by an unidentified individual in a white van as he was walking out.
An eyewitness said he heard three shots. The eyewitness said the shooter was wearing a bright jacket and dark sunglasses.
The van used in the shooting was later found torched in Hamrun. Police are suspecting the murder is linked to other crimes carried out in the last few months.
Last October, a bomb had been placed under Mr Degabriele's truck that had been parked in Fgura.
In December, he was arrested in connection with the murder in Mosta in which a man from Marsascala was killed.
Traffic chaos ensued in Marsa, spreading all the way to Msida soon after the shooting. The crime scene is the main traffic artery linking the centre of the island to the south after December 13 Road was closed for roadworks.
Magistrate Doreen Clark is holding an inquiry.
This is the second murder this year, after??Ronald Galea, a 65-year-old...				]]></description>

								Three carnival stores in Hal Farrug were completely destroyed by fire this morning.
The fire was most probably started when rubbish left outside the stores caught fire at around 11am.
The fire then spread to an adjacent Nissan Hut used by Sedqa for meetings. Two cars were at the back of this hut.
The Civil Protection Department has sent its four Hal Far units on site.
Social Solidarity Minister Marie Louise Coleiro Preca went on site to speak to carnival enthusiasts who were in tears over the loss of their goods.
They said that only recently they bought ???1,000 worth of polystyrene sheets as they started preparations for next year's carnival.				]]></description>

								Former Sliema deputy mayor Cyrus Engerer has been acquitted of circulating pornographic material and computer misuse.
Mr Engerer had pleaded not guilty to distributing obscene images of his former boyfriend and to computer misuse. His case was heard behind closed doors.
Although the former boyfriend had dropped the charges against Mr Engerer, the police acted ex-officio given the nature of the charges.
The case dates back to January 2010 when a police report was filed by the victim complaining that compromising images of him were stolen from his computer and circulated via e-mail to his employers and friends.
The police had filed charges in July 2011, days after Mr Engerer left the Nationalist Party in the wake of then Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi???s decision to vote against the divorce Bill in Parliament.
The Justice and Home Affairs Minister ordered an inquiry following claims that the police action against Mr Engerer, and also against his father who was investigated in connection with drugs, could have been politically motivated.
Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri appeared for Mr Engerer.				]]></description>

								A 23-year-old man from Valletta has been jailed for a total of one year after he was found guilty of driving without a licence and insurance and relapsing in June and August 2010.
Burgh Spiteri, 23, was also charged with not wearing a seatbelt in the August 2010 case.
Magistrate Francesco Depasquale said that taking into consideration that Mr Spiteri was a repeat offender left him with no option but to send the defendant to prison.				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								A voluntary preventative product recall of Cilest?? 250/35 Oral Contraceptive Tablets (250??g norgestimate 35??g ethinyl estradiol) is being initiated by Janssen-Cilag International N.V.
The recall is due to a reported slower than expected solubility of an active ingredient whcih can potentially lead to decreased contraceptive effect.
It has been reported that the likelihood of patients experiencing an adverse event due to this appears to be very low.
Stock of Cilest?? will be withdrawn from pharmacies.
Patients are requested to contact their doctor to be advised regarding the continuation of their treatment.
More information can be obtained on 2343 9000.				]]></description>

								Dressed in a colourful lab coat and complete with a big, red shiny nose, Dr Gimme5 hopped into one of the outpatients??? clinics, where a young boy is nervously waiting to have a blood test.
As the clown bends down to fasten her loosened shoelaces, an avalanche of knick-knacks exploded out of her pocket ??? and the boy???s furrowed face instantly gave way to a beaming smile.
???We distract the children through the element of surprise,??? said Corinne Wood, the person behind the antics.
???We improvise, fool about and make fun of ourselves. Hospitals are generally negative places and we help bring positivity and warmth. It???s a very fulfilling experience ??? it gives me a great boost which gets me through any black moments I may encounter in my life.???
The 46-year-old mother of five, who happens to be a doctor by profession, forms part of Dr Klown, an NGO which stimulates the therapeutic effect of laughter by entertaining children re??ceiving care in the wards and outpatients??? clinics of Mater Dei Hospital.

The voluntary organisation, which was set up in 2009 by Jean Paul Fabri and Jean Pierre Busuttil, is now looking for new recruits to join its troop of clowns.
