													Air Malta is gearing up to celebrate the 40th anniversary since its inaugural flight. The airline???s first flight, from Malta to London Heathrow, took off on April 1, 1974.
The passengers on board the Boeing 720B aircraft were mostly journalists and travel agents flying to meet their British counterparts for a six-hour reception in London.
To mark the occasion, Air Malta is planning a number of activities and initiatives including a special April edition of its in-flight magazine, ???Il-Bizzilla???.
In its first year of operation, Air Malta carried 53,459 passengers. This annual figure has now grown to 1.7 million, with almost 50 million passengers carried over the past 40 years.
This year, the aviation community is also marking the 100th anniversary of the start of commercial aviation. The first scheduled commercial airline flight took place on January 1st, 1914 in Florida, from St Petersburg to Tampa.								]]></description>

													A decision by the Armed Forces of Malta not to allow a soldier to resit a practical exam to be promoted to the rank of Driver B2 was abusive and unreasonable, a court ruled today.
Kevin Azzopardi filed an application against the Prime Minister and the Commander of the Armed Forces complaining he had been the victim of administratative action when he had not been allowed to resit an exam which could lead to a promotion.
Mr Justice Joseph R Micallef said Mr Azzopardi joined the AFM in 1992 and held the rank of lance bombardier.
A call for applications for the grade of Driver B2 was issued in April 2008. Mr Azzopardi submitted his application. All candidates were required to sit for a written and a practical exam.
As many had applied, the army decided to split the applicants in two groups. The first group were to have their written exam on April 28, 2008 and the practical exam on the following day, the second group were to have their written exam on May 26, 2008 and the practical exam on May 27.
The resit for the practical exam was to be held on June 5, 2008 and for the written exam on June 12, 2008. The latter resit was limited to the second group only. Mr Azzopardi had formed...								]]></description>

													The Melita Group is being sold and the first round of bidding has been completed, according to TMT Finance.
The portal said that the first round bids were submitted on March 20.
Melita chairman Joe Gasan declined to comment for the moment.
He said: ???Melita was purchased in 2007 by private equity firms. It is quite normal for investors to build up a company and sell it on within four to six years. Now that six years are up and the company???s value has been built up and it is doing well, it is a fact that it would sooner or later be sold as a going concern.???
He declined to comment on the value of the company.
TMT Finance quoted sources saying that the company, owned by GMT Communications Partners, MC Venture Partners, Gasan Group and Blackrock Communications Ltd, is valued at up to ???300 million
The Melita group offers cable TV, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, and mobile voice and data services.
No announcements identifying participating bidders have been made but it is understood that interest from private equity firms and telecoms groups has been attracted, according to sources

													Hollywood star Angelina Jolie has joined UK Foreign Secretary William Hague to hail Bosnia's decision to include prevention of sexual violence in military training.
The pair addressed a conference on sexual violence in conflict, organised in Sarajevo by Bosnia's Defence Ministry, saying the "groundbreaking" policy should become standard for any armed forces serving in UN peacekeeping missions.
Jolie said the initiative is "redefining soldiering in the 21st century".
Mr Hague promised the UK will support a planned training centre in Sarajevo for future military and police peacekeepers from the region.
He added that rape is a cheap and devastatingly effective way to terrorise and displace a population and is being used currently in Syria, Central African Republic and South Sudan.								]]></description>

													Valletta 2018 Foundation this morning marked Valletta???s Foundation Day in an activity with school children at Our Lady of Victory Church, Valletta.
Children from St ??or?? Preca College, St Elmo Primary School, Valletta, were shown around the church on occasion of the 448th anniversary of the capital's foundation.
Valletta 2018 Foundation chairman Jason Micallef addressed the children.
Staff from Din l-Art ??elwa, which is undertaking the restoration works of the church and its treasures, explained to the children how the Our Lady of Victory Church was the first building of the new capital city. It stands on the spot where a religious ceremony was held to inaugurate the laying of the foundation stone of the new city on 28th March 1566. It also commemorates the victory over the Ottoman Empire during the ???Great Siege??? of 1565.
Grand Master De Valette was originally buried at the church and his remains were later transferred to St John???s Co-Cathedral. In 1617, the Order of St John named Our Lady of Victory Church as Church of the Order.
Significant changes to the fa??ade, the sacristy, the belfry and the residence of the parish priest were made over the years. The church suffered...								]]></description>

													A former editor of il-Mument was today cleared of libelling former Police Commissioner Lawrence Pullicino by the Court of Appeal.
The Magistrates??? Court had found Victor Camilleri guilty of libelling Mr Pullicino in an article published in April 1997 and he was ordered to pay Mr Pullicino ???1,747.
The article had claimed that Mr Pullicino enjoyed privileges during his detention at Corradino Correctional Facilities. The court had found him guilty for failing to prove allegations.
But Chief Justice Silvio Camilleri, Mr Justice Tonio Mallia and Mr Justice Joseph Azzopardi said in their appeal that for allegations to be libellous, they had to attack the reputation of a person.
To allege that a person called whenever he wanted and was allowed in places others were not, as had been done in this article, could not amount to damaging one???s reputation.
Such allegations threw a bad light on the facility and not on the person. Moreover, Mr Pullicino was not a common man but a former Police Commissioner who was found guilty and jailed. He was a person in the public eye.
In this case, favouritism towards Mr Pullicino had also been confirmed by the director of prisons.
Mr Pullicino was, for...								]]></description>

													The hospital IT system developed in-house could be the government's major flaw of this legislature, according to Opposition health spokesman Claudio Grech.
He said the negative consequences of this decision could be felt "for years to come".
"I asked for information in Parliament and the replies were simple one-liners... The minister said the system was so reliable that no maintenance agreement was necessary because it could be maintained internally," Mr Grech, said, adding this did not bode well for such a critical IT system.
Mr Grech was speaking this morning as he presented "a critical review" of the health sector.
He said the review, which contained positive and negative elements, was "evidence-based" and not a personal attack on the minister.
An overall assessment showed that the government's handling of the health sector in its first year fell short of patients' expectations. "The government has limped from one crisis to another," Mr Grech said.
The instability created by uncertainty over the future direction has weakened management, he added. The first year of the administration was characterised by unclear strategic direction, he added. "There was very limited vision for...								]]></description>

													A woman who lost her two year old daughter and who was herself seriously injured in a traffic accident in January 2005 has been awarded ???208,477 in damages.
Marthese Vella in her own name and as heir of her late daughter Hayley Anne Briffa filed for damages against Karl Micallef and Joseph Azzopardi. The Protection and Compensation Fund (set up in terms of the Insurance Business Act) and the Motor Insurers' Bureau intervened into the suit in 2008.
Ms Vella told the court that while she was pushing her daughter in a pushchair on the pavement of Ghammieri Street, Qormi, they were hit by a car driven by Mr Micallef. The car belonged to Mr Azzopardi but was not licensed nor was it covered by insurance.
Her baby died as a result of the collision while she suffered a permanent disability.
Mr Justice Mark Chetcuti heard that at the time of the accident Mr Micallef was 18 - and had got his driving licence some two months previously. He had just started working for Mr Azzopardi on a trial basis as a flower delivery man.
The car's licence and insurance had expired in October 2004 and Mr Azzopardi told the court that he had not renewed them for financial reasons.
The court heard that a few...								]]></description>

													Government today published a legal notice ???Conservation of Wild Birds (Amendment) Regulations??? increasing penalties for illegal shooting or taking of protected birds ten-fold.
As from today, anyone convicted of shooting or trapping protected species, even in the case of a first time offence, will automatically incur a ???5,000 fine, and/or imprisonment for one year, as well as permanent revocation or ban on obtaining a hunting or trapping license. In the case of second or subsequent offence, the applicable penalty will go up to ???10,000, confiscation, and/or imprisonment for two years.
Parliamentary Secretary Roderick Galdes said that the recent spate of incidents involving protected birds demonstrated that despite previous increases in legal deterrents and improvements in field enforcement, the problem of illegal targeting of protected birds still needed to be fully addressed.
???These harsher penalties are definitely expected to have a huge effect on the overall enforcement situation.???
The increases, he said, formed part of a broader package of measures that would, collectively, help stamp out illegal targeting of protected birds.

													A plane has spotted objects in the Indian Ocean of the first day of searching a new location for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, but officials say it will take until tomorrow to determine whether they are related to the lost plane.
The search area moved 680 miles to the north east earlier today, and a New Zealand military plane, one of nine aircraft involved in the hunt, found the objects, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said on Twitter.
Amsa said the find needs to be confirmed by a ship which is expected to arrive in the area tomorrow.
The search area was shifted after new radar data analysis suggested the jet flew faster than originally thought and would have used up more fuel, which might have reduced the distance it travelled.
Amsa said the change in search area came from new information based on continuing analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost with Flight 370 early on March 8.
"This is our best estimate of the area in which the aircraft is likely to have crashed into the ocean," said Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.
The new search area is more than 600...								]]></description>

George Gatt, 21, of Mosta was charged with shooting the black-winged stilt in Xatt il-Pwales, Xemxija, being in possession of a protected bird, carrying a firearm not in accordance to licence conditions, firing the weapon at less than 200 metres from an inhabited area and concealing the car???s number plates.
Dominic Borg, 24, of Mosta was charged with assisting Mr Gatt commit the crime, carrying his gun and relapsing.
Mr Gatt allegedly shot the bird which Mr Borg then picked up.
Inspector Jurgen Vella prosecuted and lawyer Edward Gatt appeared for the accused.
On Wednesday, Joseph Camilleri, 55, of ??ebbu??, pleaded not guilty to assisting Lee Grima, 24, to shoot a black-winged stilt on Monday at around 12.30pm in Qajjenza, limits of Bir??ebbu??a.
On Tuesday, Mr Grima pleaded guilty to killing the bird and carrying a loaded shotgun during the closed season and in an area where hunting was not permitted.
He was jailed for three months, suspended for a year and fined ???1,000. His hunting licence was suspended for two years and his gun...								]]></description>

													Prime Minister Joseph Muscat appealed to financial institutions to choose wisely the projects they financed, giving due importance to those which bring value added to the Maltese economy.
He said the economic results which were being achieved, including the fact that Malta outperformed expectations of international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund, were encouraging.
These gave credibility to the island and which was resulting in ???unprecedented??? foreign direct investment. He mentioned the minority shareholding in ???loss-making Enemalta??? the government managed to sell to Shanghai Electric.
Dr Muscat was speaking during the inauguration of the completely refurbished House of Four Winds in Valletta which will be the new Bank of Valletta premises for its board meetings.
He said the citizenship scheme was bringing to Malta people with new and global networks, which financial institutions should tap to help in the internationalisation of local small enterprises.
BOV chairman John Cassar White said the bank was gearing up for challenges ahead, including the ongoing asset quality review being carried out by the European Central Bank as well as the upgrading of the bank???s...								]]></description>

													Some 135 business and hotels saved 141 million litres of water through a sustainable resource management project headed by the Malta Business Bureau.
The project, EU Life+ Investing in Water, lasted 30 months and focused on simple solutions to industrial water management.
Coordinator Geoffrey Saliba said the water savings amounted to the entire annual consumption of three medium-sized hotels and two factories.

The project???s team carried out consumption audits on hotels and businesses which revealed they were wasting as much as 15 litres per toilet flush.
Mr Saliba said several hotel showers were also causing a severe strain on the island???s water resources. Some, he said, had a flow rate of as much as 30 litres per minute.
The team audited half of the island???s hotels and found that most exceeded the recommended consumption rate.
In many instances, the situation was reversed through the introduction of pressure controllers and aerators to showers and the promotion of in house water treatment facilities.
The project identified a potential national consumption reduction of 37 per cent if all hotels were to introduce the recommended measures.
This, Mr Saliba said, would translate in...								]]></description>

The main contributors to this increase were income tax (???101.7 million), grants (???80.9 million), value added tax (???53 million), social security (???35.6 million) and customs and excise duties (???22.6 million).
Compared to 2012, higher spending was registered in recurrent and capital expenditures, resulting in an increase in total expenditure of ???177.3 million.
Recurrent expenditure went up by ???144.2 million, primarily as a result of higher spending on programmes and initiatives (???81.7 million) and on personal emoluments (???41.2 million).

Prime Minister Joseph Muscat did not deny when asked this morning to confirm whether beds from St Philip???s Hospital, which closed down two years ago due to financial difficulties, were being moved to St Luke???s Hospital to create two new acute wards there.
???We are analysing and reviewing a number of agreements and looking at different options. This is being done in the context of a holistic plan the government intends to announce through a press conference in the coming days,??? he said.
PN health spokesman Claudio Grech said when asked about the matter that If such a decision was taken hewould expect the government to announce it because it wasa significant development.
"In a spirt of consensus I would have expected some form of consultation with the Opposition, given that certain wards at a hospital that has been closed will be reopened. I don't know whether there was consultation with the unions. I am not saying we should...								]]></description>

													The judge in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius has delayed proceedings until April 7.
Judge Thokozile Masipa said today that one of her two assessors, legal experts who are helping her with the case, was unwell and that the trial had to be delayed.
Defence lawyers for the double-amputee runner who killed his girlfriend last year were due to begin their case today after four weeks of prosecution-led testimony.
Pistorius said he shot Reeva Steenkamp by accident, mistaking her for an intruder in his home.
Prosecutors say he killed her after an argument.								]]></description>
