								Former Alternattiva Demokratika chairman Arnold Cassola has submitted his nomination for a return to the post.
Prof. Cassola submitted his nomination in the past days after the party postponed its general meeting as no nominations for party chairman were submitted.
The closing date for nominations was then postponed until June 13. Prof. Cassola???s nomination is the only one so far.
He said this afternoon he hoped his nomination would be a bridge between the next 12 months, when European Parliament elections are due, and the future, when there would hopefully be others who would offer their services to the party.
Prof. Cassola served as chairman of AD between June 2008 and October 2009				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Concert-goers won't have to leave their homes to enjoy the "Live Music Day Festival," the biggest online-only event of its kind, music networks MTV, VH1 and CMT said.
The 24-hour virtual concert is set to kick off at 7 p.m. EDT on June 19 and will feature performances by more than 50 bands and artists spanning rock, indie, pop, R&B and folk. Acts include Hanson, Atlas Genius, Labrinth, Langhorne Slim and Kate Nash.
The performances, accompanied by the fan-picked O Music Awards, will be streamed live from Viacom's offices in New York, Nashville and Los Angeles. The Roots drummer Questlove will provide beats during the festival in a 24-hour "drum-a-thon."
Viewers will be able to watch the entire show via computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones. They also have the option of selecting only the acts and awards they want to see.
"We've created the first-of-its-kind music festival that's both connecting artists and fans and allowing them to participate in the awards and festival in new ways," Dermot McCormack, head of connected content for Viacom Music, said in a statement.
Categories in the third annual O Music Awards include Best Web-Born Artist, Fan Army FTW (For The Win) and...				]]></description>

								A man has been fined ???1,500 and had his driving licence suspended for a month after he ran over a young man and kept on going on New Year's Eve. 
Stephen Theuma, 46, from Rabat hit Horace Coleiro on Saqqajja Hill, Rabat?? as he drove down the hill..
Mr Coleiro was on his way to Tattingers nightclub.
The car then hit Mr Coleiro pushing him to the ground and drove over one of his legs with the back wheel, breaking it and tearing three ligaments, the court heard.
Mr Coleiro had his leg encased in plaster for three months and suffered a 10 per cent disability.
The accused said that when driving down the hill, he saw a group of people standing on the pavement waiting to get into Tattingers nightclub. He was driving slowly when all of the sudden he heard a loud sound which he realised was his side view mirror which had just popped back into place.
He saw many people but no one called for him to stop so he continued on his way to Valletta when he was called to speak to the police at around 2am.
Mr Theuma said he thought that someone had hit his mirror and no one got injured.
Magistrate Audrey Demicoli said that he failed to keep a proper look out and instead of being cautious when faced...				]]></description>

								Energy giant Shell, Italian company Edison and the Chinese state-owned CPECC are among the short listed bidders for a gas-fired power plant at Delimara.
The announcement was made this afternoon by Energy Minister Konrad Mizzi at the end of an evaluation process that whittled down the field to 11 companies from the 19 that had responded to a call for expression of interest.
Dr Mizzi said the eliminated companies were given a reason for the evaluation board's decision. A legal notice that will be published in the coming days will give the eliminated companies a chance to appeal.
He said Enemalta will conduct a full environmental impact assessment of the project. This will be finished by September when the contract will be awarded.
Dr Mizzi said a project description statement will be published shortly. The terms of reference for the EIA will be based on the project description statement and all studies will be done during the summer months.
Asked whether the deadline for cutting electricity bills for families by March next year will be respected, Dr Mizzi said the process was "on track".
He said the short-listing exercise was based on the technical capability and financial strength...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								A thief in the UK stole a car with a baby still in the rear seat before returning a few minutes later with the child.
The baby's mother had left three children in her unlocked Renault Scenic while she made a delivery in Tiverton in Devon at 11.55am on Saturday.
Her daughter stood outside the vehicle and the woman's five-year-old nephew and 14-month-old son remained in the back.
But as they waited for the mother to return, a thief opened the rear door of the car and pulled the nephew out.
The man, in his 40s, then drove the vehicle through a series of one-way streets before returning to the original location, Kings Street.
He removed the child seat with the boy and dumped it on the pavement - telling passers-by that someone had abandoned a baby.
The suspect jumped back into the car and drove off.
A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said the vehicle had not been found.
He said: "The vehicle was in collision with a bollard at St Pauls Close, causing significant damage but the suspect continued to drive.
"Police units and a helicopter were called out but despite substantial searches of the area, the vehicle has not been found.
Police are still searching for the car.				]]></description>

								Two men have been taken to court, accused of trying to bribe a Futsal football player.
Ronnie MacKay, a soldier from Marsa aged 31 and Futsal player Chris Brincat, 27 of Floriana, pleaded not guilty to having, on September 27 last, tried to bribe Nigerian Sunday Eboh. The attempt took place shortly before a Gzira vs Naxxar match.
The court was told that recordings of the alleged bribery attempt existed, having been made by Mr Eboh.
Police Inspector Malvyn Camilleri asked the court to authorise a voice comparison test to confirm that the voices on the tape were those of the accused.
Lawyers Franco Debono and Veronique Dalli objected. Dr Debono said that contrary to, say, fingerprints, such a test was not provided for by law and the accused had a right to remain silent even in this context.
The court will announce its decision in another sitting.				]]></description>

								Swathes of suburban Prague were under water today after floods which have killed 11 people swept across central Europe, and the deluge moved towards Germany where more than 10,000 people have been forced from their homes.
Areas to the south and north of the Czech capital were submerged, including the city's zoo and horse racing track, in the worst flooding in a decade which followed days of heavy rain. But metal barriers erected along the Vltava river banks protected the historical city centre.
Forecasters said receding rains would help water levels to drop across the Czech Republic, but that parts of Germany, Slovakia and Hungary, would be hit in the coming days.
In Germany, about 10,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in low-lying areas of Saxony and thousands more from parts of Bavaria.
The 11 deaths since the weekend occurred across the Czech Republic, Austria, Poland and Germany, with the latest two reported in the south German town of Guenzburg, on the Danube.
Many rivers across the region have broken their banks and spilled across the countryside.
High water is likely to stop shipping on the Rhine in south Germany until at least Thursday morning, a state agency...				]]></description>

								Romina Delia-Guntrip, 38, was today fined ???500 after being convicted of abandoning a kitten in Paceville.
Ms Delia-Guntrip told Magistrate Carol Peralta that she had acquired the kitten but subsequently realised she could not take of it because her daughter had asthma.
She therefore took the cat to Paceville because, she said, she had heard that several people took care of cats there.
Magistrate Carol Peralta said this was not the way to dispose of unwanted pets and there were proper channels to do so. He fined her ???500.

								More than a fifth (22 per cent) of the food purchased weekly by people in Malta ends up in the solid waste stream, according to the National Statistics Office.
In a statement to mark World Environment Day 2013 tomorrow, the NSO said that meat and meat products constituted the largest expense in the local food basket (23 per cent).
This was followed by bread and cereals (19 per cent) and milk and cheese (15 per cent).
It was estimated that residents consumed 12.17 kilogrammes of food per capita on a weekly basis, or 1.73 kilogrammes daily. This consumption pattern cost, on average, ???26 per week for every resident.
The average food waste generation in Maltese households was 55.8 per cent, an average 0.38 kilogrammes per capita of solid waste per day.
Destruction of foodstuffs, either to expiry or as a result of inferior quality standards, wasalso considered as food waste.
In 2011, 34.4 tonnes of food were destroyed, rising to 95.7 tonnes in 2012
This year???s World Environment Day theme is ???Think.Eat.Save???. The objective is to raise awareness to reduce food waste, save money, minimise the environmental impact of food production and enable food production processes to become more...				]]></description>

								Former Nationalist MP Jean-Pierre Farrugia has taken a dig at his party over criticism of the government's plan to appoint MPs to go government boards and authorities.
In a facebook post over the story published on timesofmalta.com yesterday, Dr Farrugia said people in glasshouses should not throw stones.
It was for this reason, he said, that in 2010 he had refused executive posts both as a chairman or as a parliamentary assistant.
He said the phrase 'people in glasshouses should not throw stones' applied to all those who opted to accept executive posts.
Opposition leader Simon Busuttil said yesterday that the government's plan to remove legal bans on the appointment of MPs to government boards was rich, coming from Labour which had criticised the former government when ministers were awarded their honoraria as MPs.
Prime Minister Joseph Muscat retorted that the government wanted to broaden the role of MPs - which could include Opposition MPs - and what was being proposed was far better than appointing parliamentary assistants with no specified role.				]]></description>

								Paedophiles will not benefit from a partial amnesty to prisoners which is being considered by the government, a spokesman for the Home Affairs Ministry confirmed today.
The partial amnesty - of up to three months - is expected to be announced this evening.
A number of non-governmental organisations are helping the government to come up with the right formula.
The amnesty will be given to mark the general election.
A spokesman told timesofmalta.com the amnesty will be based on prisoners??? behaviour and will not be given to paedophiles and prisoners who have been imprisoned for life, among others.
???One thing is definite. If we give prisoners an amnesty, paedophiles will not get 10 minutes of it,??? the spokesman said.
The last time that an amnesty was given to prisoners was when Pope John Paul II visited Malta in May 2001.				]]></description>

								Commuters were left temporarily stranded in Tokyo today when an unexploded bomb left over from the Second World War was found on a building site.
The discovery halted the long range bullet trains and local services into and out of the Japanese capital.
The bomb, about 40 centimeters long. was destroyed on the site by a bomb squad.
A large amount of unexploded ordnance is still found in Tokyo and other areas that were heavily bombed before Japan's 1945 surrender ended the Second World War. Most of the duds were dropped by the United States, but some were buried or lost by the Japanese military.				]]></description>

								Demonstrators continued to clash with the police last night over plans to raze a park in Turkey.
Brick by brick, demonstrators built barricades to block the roads leading to Taksim Square and Gezi Park.
The demos started last week but quickly gained steam to include thousands of people who now occupy the park.
The group opposes a government plan to pedestrianise the area into a shopping center and luxury flats.
Turkish Prime Minsiter Tayyip Erdogan, who arrived in Morocco yesterday for bilateral meetings accused his political rivals of spurring the protests. The situation is calm now and people have started using their senses, he said.
Taksim Square was established to symbolise the ideals of the secular Turkish republic that was founded by Kemal Ataturk in 1923 after the Ottoman empire collapsed.
But since the protests broke out, Erdogan has appeared to grow more resolute with his plans- now he says, he has plans to build a mosque there.

								The previous government paid ???17,509 to the general secretary of the hunters??? federation in 2012 for ???consultancy??? about hunting and trapping, according to information published in Parliament.
Lino Farrugia was paid in seven instalments for consultancy services provided between 2011 and 2012, which he gave on behalf of the Federation for Hunting and Conservation (FKNK).
Contracts were awarded by direct order, according to the information supplied by Tourism Minister Karmenu Vella in response to a parliamentary question by Labour MP Chris Agius.
Former Environment Minister Mario de Marco told Times of Malta the practice began under his predecessor, George Pullicino, and continued when he was minister in the last year of the Nationalist legislature.
He could not, from memory, remember exactly what the consultancy was for but his former permanent secretary said there was a specific contract stipulating what FKNK???s responsibilities were, such as the writing of certain reports every year.
He said the Government would require FKNK???s advice, especially on issues discussed with the European hunting lobby group.
When contacted, Mr Pullicino recalled that money was given to FKNK to help...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								The EU???s anti-fraud agency has not yet concluded its investigation into a group of local councillors charged in Malta with defrauding the European Commission.
OLAF officials had still to speak to the suspects to get their versions of events before closing the case file, sources close to the investigation said.
The case first came to light when OLAF noticed that a large number of airline tickets for which reimbursement was sought all cost the same.
Magistrate Edwina Grima heard that the tickets were issued by KD Travel Services Limited to the Local Council Association and to its members, who had private accounts with the travel agency.
The total amount reimbursed totalled ???96,000. Handwritten invoices indicated one fare whereas a computer printout showed a fare that was markedly lower. One ticket, for example, was marked as costing ???599 when it was bought for ???446, according to evidence produced in court.
The councillors, who are all pleading not guilty, are: the deputy mayor of Birkirkara, Doris Borg, 76; the former mayor of Mellie??a, Joseph Borg, 71; the mayor of San Lawrenz, Noel Formosa, 39; the former executive secretary of the Fgura local council and former LCA secretary,...				]]></description>

								Criminal gangs attacking each other is not a new phenomenon but the audacity of recent killings shocked people, according to a criminologist.
Saviour Formosa says fighting between gangs happened in the past but the latest spate of murders is worrying because of the place where they occurred.
???The methodology used is shocking because killings have happened in public places, sometimes in full view of others, with the assailants unbothered by the attention,??? Dr Formosa notes.
Killings involving different gang members are normally associated with a turf war that may have economic implications, he explains, but settling scores in public places seems to be a new phenomenon.

He does not rule out that the murders were carried out by foreign hit men but is cautious on this line of reasoning. Maltese criminals may be using this method to make it seem like a foreigner did it, he quickly adds.
Police historian Eddie Attard records 25 murders over the past five years of which nine remain unsolved. Three of the unsolved murders involved drive-by shootings where the victims were killed at almost point-blank range.
Businessman Joseph Baldacchino was shot in 2010 soon after parking his car near...				]]></description>
