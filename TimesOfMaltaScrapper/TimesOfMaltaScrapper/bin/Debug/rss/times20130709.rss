								Whole-life jail terms without the possibility of review amount to a breach of human rights, European judges have ruled.
The case was instituted against the UK but the implications are international.
Murderer Jeremy Bamber and two other killers, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore, have won an appeal in the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights that their sentences amount to inhuman and degrading treatment.
The court found that for a life sentence to remain compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights there had to be both a possibility of release and a possibility of review. However, the panel of 17 judges added: "In finding a violation in this case, however, the court did not intend to give the applicants any prospect of imminent release."
The appeal was brought by Vinter, who stabbed his wife in February 2008, and means the cases of Bamber, who killed his parents, sister and her two young children in August 1985, and Moore, who killed four gay men for his sexual gratification in 1995, will also be considered.
In their ruling, the judges said it was up to the national authorities to decide when such a review should take place. However, existing legal...				]]></description>

								A severe thunderstorm caused flash flooding in Toronto, cutting power to at least 300,000 in Canada's largest city, shutting down subways, and leaving about 1,400 passengers stranded for hours on a commuter train filled with gushing water.
Environment Canada said some parts of the city had been drenched with more than 3.9in (10cm) of rain in the storm, easily beating the previous one-day rainfall record of 1.4in (3.6cm) in 2008.
Toronto police and firefighters used small inflatable boats to rescue commuters from a 10-car, double-decker Go Transit train that stalled in floodwater that reached up to the lower windows. Murky brown water spilled through the bottom floor of the carriages, sending passengers fleeing to the upper decks
A Metrolinx spokeswoman said power was shut off and the windows were cranked opened to provide ventilation. The train was carrying about 1,400 passengers during the evening rush-hour.
"There's a full-on river on either side of us... We. Are. Stuck. Hard," passenger Jonah Cait wrote on Twitter.
Another passenger told the TV news network CP24 that she could see people clinging to trees after abandoning their cars on a flooded highway alongside the...				]]></description>

								Lack of social mobility is leading to an unacceptable situation where the poor cannot improve their lives, according to the Government???s consultant on poverty Yana Mintoff Bland.
???The bottom 10 per cent of our community is getting less than ???5,700 a year. It???s impossible to live on that and they hardly have any chance to get out of that situation. Only one in seven are upwardly mobile. The lack of social mobility is not acceptable,??? Dr Mintoff Bland told Times of Malta.
Sitting on a plastic chair in a Marsa square last week, she waited for the first of a series of public consultation meetings about poverty to start.
The meetings will be held throughout this month and will help her draw up a 10-year national strategic plan for poverty reduction and social exclusion that will be drafted by September.
???I???m hoping people will share their challenges??? I want to base the plan on reality,??? she said.
She feels she learnt a lot about respecting the poor from her father, former Prime Minister Dom Mintoff, who passed away last summer.

???I grew up in an atmosphere where the poor were not just respected, but seen as the salt of the earth. I appreciate people???s resilience. It???s just amazing.				]]></description>

								The trial of the captain of the Costa Concordia cruise ship, which capsized off Italy's coast last year killing 32 people, was delayed just as it started today because of a lawyers' strike.
The giant Concordia flipped on its side outside the Tuscan port of Giglio in January 2012 after it struck rocks during a manoeuvre that brought it too close to shore.

Captain Francesco Schettino, who left the ship before all its crew and passengers had been rescued, faces charges including multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship.
He argues that he managed to prevent a worse disaster by steering the vessel into shallow waters after the impact to help the rescue operation.
He arrived at the theatre where hearings are being held in the Tuscan town of Grosseto wearing a blue suit and sunglasses, declining to answer questions from a scrum of reporters.
The trial was immediately postponed until July 17 because the lawyers involved in the case were taking part in the nationwide strike to protest at measures aimed at streamlining civil trials.
Lawyers, whose strike is due to last until July 16, are also angry at Justice Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri accusing them of blocking reforms.

								Marsaxlokk mayor Edric Micallef this morning called on the Government to "take on board" a 1997 proposal to create a Delimara National Park which had been subsequently withdrawn.
Speaking during a Cabinet meeting held in his locality as part of a new Government initiative, Mr Micallef said the park could incorporate the historical sites and recreational zones in the area. He pointed out that the Xrobb l-Ghagin Park developed in the area was a "positive project" which was carried out on the initiative of Nature Trust.
He also called for a breakwater and a hardstanding facility for small boats to help the fishing community and said a site that could house a yard had been identified by the local council in Triq it-Trunciera.
On the power station, Mr Micallef said it was very positive to remove Delimara's Phase 1, including the chimney. However, he said it remained a fact that Marsaxlokk was carrying the brunt of environmental consequences for the islands to have electricity.
Speaking before the presentation by Mr Micallef, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said the Cabinet was starting to hold meetings in various localities to get a good idea of the challenges and opportunities faced in...				]]></description>

								Osama bin Laden lived in plain sight for almost a decade and was once even pulled over for speeding but not apprehended, thanks to the incompetence of Pakistan's intelligence and security services, an official report into his killing said on Monday.
The report, leaked to Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera which circulated it late on Monday, offers fascinating details about life on the run for the world's most wanted man, who, it says, wore a cowboy hat to avoid being spotted from above.
Written by a judge-led commission that the Pakistani government set up shortly after U.S. special forces killed bin Laden in 2011, the 336-page report is based on interviews with 201 sources including members of his family and various officials.
In one testimony showing how close bin Laden came to being captured, "Maryam", the wife of one of his most trusted aides, recounted how his car was stopped by Pakistani police in the Swat region.
"Once when they were all ... on a visit to the bazaar they were stopped for speeding by a policeman," the report says. "But her (Maryam's) husband quickly settled the matter with the policeman and they drove on."

								Two passenger buses plunged into a fast-flowing river when a bridge collapsed after two days of heavy rain in a mountainous part of China, authorities said today.
An unknown number of other vehicles and pedestrians were believed to have been crossing the Tongkou River when the bridge gave way in the city of Jiangyou in the western province of Sichuan.
Officials said rescue work was under way, but there was no immediate word on casualties.
The two-lane Qinglian Bridge was built in 1967 and a replacement span is under construction.
China has been pouring resources into building infrastructure, but many older bridges and dams are of poor quality and urgently need repairs or replacement.				]]></description>

								Investigators probing an oil train derailment and blaze which killed at least 13 people and wiped out the centre of a small town are focusing on an earlier fire on the same train and the possibility that the actions which followed it might have somehow caused the locomotive's brakes to fail several hours later.
Inspectors, meanwhile, are searching for remains in the wreckage after finally being cleared to enter the area - almost three days after the disaster. A total of 50 people are missing, including the 13 unidentified victims, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The rail tankers which exploded had a history of puncturing during accidents, but investigators acknowledged that it was too soon to tell whether that was a factor in the blasts.
All but one of the train's 73 cars were carrying oil. At least five of the tankers blew up after coming loose early on Saturday, speeding downhill for nearly 11 kilometers before derailing in the town of Lac-Megantic, near the Maine border.
Maude Verrault, a waitress at the Musi-Cafe, was outside smoking when she spotted the blazing train barrelling toward her.

								Egypt's interim head of state has set a speedy timetable for elections to drag the Arab world's biggest country from crisis, after the military ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi last week sparked a wave of bloody protests.
A decree issued by Adli Mansour pointed to a parliamentary ballot within about six months with a presidential vote to follow. However, it was faulted for repeating flaws in the 2011 transition plan that contributed to the current crisis.
The need for a political breakthrough is pressing.
At least 51 people were killed on Monday when the army opened fire on Mursi supporters camped outside Cairo's Republican Guard barracks where the deposed leader is believed to be held.
The military said it opened fire in response to an attack by armed assailants. On Friday, clashes between pro- and anti-Mursi supporters swept Egypt and left 35 dead.
Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood movement called for more protests on Tuesday, raising the risk of further violence, although an umbrella group representing anti-Mursi protesters said they would not demonstrate.
The bloodshed has shocked Egyptians, already tired of the turbulence that began 2-1/2 years ago with the overthrow of...				]]></description>

								A group of 102 migrants was brought to Malta early this morning, bringing to 400 the number of arrivals in a week. The new group included 41 women and two babies.
The migrants were spotted on a dinghy close to the Delimara coast and escorted to the AFM Maritime Base by a patrol boat at about 6 am.
A group of 290 mostly Eritrean migrants was brought to Malta on Thursday.
Last week's arrival prompted Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to warn the EU that Malta would demand solidarity from other EU member states and would use its veto on unrelated issues to press its point. Dr Muscat phoned EU Council president Herman Van Rompuy to give him ???formal notice??? of Malta???s intentions. Mr Van Rompuy is due to visit Malta on Thursday on a previously scheduled visit.
Dr Muscat also declared himself in favour of a push-back policy while saying Malta would be compassionate with the migrants, but firm with politicians from whom it expected solidarity.

								The manuscript containing the earliest known Maltese poem ??? the Kantilena by Pietro Caxaro ??? has been restored and given a new cover.
Also restored were the notarial deeds of Brandano Caxaro between 1533 and 1536, as the notary had included his uncle Pietro???s poem, forming one volume.
???The random inclusion of the poem on the penultimate leaf comes as no surprise because notaries used to add similar notes at the end, but it is interesting that the poem is not written in Latin, the language used for notarial deeds of those times,??? conservator Theresa Zammit Lupi told Times of Malta.
Pietro died in 1485 so the Kantilena was definitely written before that date but it was not until five centuries later that Godfrey Wettinger and Fr Mikiel Fsadni stumbled across the medieval poem at the Notarial Archives in Strait Street, Valletta.
The Dominican priest and historian from Vittoriosa passed away earlier this year, aged 97.

The manuscript is now housed in the Notarial Archives in St Christopher Street in Valletta.
Sponsored by Akkademja tal-Malti, Dr Zammit Lupi was tasked with restoring the volume by the Notarial Archives Resources Council.
She said the manuscript had been rebound and...				]]></description>

								Malta had the highest positive decision rate in the EU last year when it came to processing applications for the international protection of migrants, according to a report.
Ninety per cent of the 1,590 first instance applications lodged were accepted, with the vast majority being for subsidiary protection.
This is given when there are substantial grounds to believe that, if returned to his country of origin, the applicant would suffer harm.
While the number of applications was small by European standards ??? considering that France decided almost 60,000 cases ??? they were very significant for Malta given its small population, the report says.
This emerged in the 2012 Annual Report on the Situation of Asylum in the EU. Compiled by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), the report provides a comprehensive overview of the requests for international protection made in the EU.
Data shows that the Maltese Refugee Commissioner received a total of 2,080 applications for international protection, making 2012 the second highest year since 2001 in terms of the number of irregular arrivals on the island and the number of applications for international protection received.

								The following are the top stories in the Maltese and overseas press.
The Times of Malta reports how the Pope commemorated migrant deaths at sea.
The Malta Independent says the Pope blasted indifference over migrant deaths.

The overseas press
There has been a strong world reaction to yesterday???s violence in Egypt which has left 51 people dead and more than 400 others injured outside the Egyptian military headquarters when supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi demonstrated near the Republican Guard building in Cairo. Al Ahram reports protesters saying the troops attacked their encampment without provocation just after dawn prayers. The military, meanwhile, said it only fired warning shots and tear gas ??? blaming armed civilians on the site for the bloodshed.
Deutsche Welle says the European Union has condemned the massacre. It quotes EU foreign policy spokesman Michael Mann saying the EU had no plans to change its aid regime but added that it was keeping its aid to...				]]></description>

								At least 51 people were killed yesterday when demonstrators enraged by the military overthrow of Egypt???s elected Islamist president said the army opened fire during morning prayers outside the Cairo barracks where Mohamed Morsi is believed held.
But the military said ???a terrorist group??? tried to storm the Republican Guard compound and one army officer had been killed and 40 wounded. Soldiers returned fire when they were attacked by armed assailants, according to a military source.
In the deadliest incident since Morsi???s removal, emergency services said more than 430 were wounded.
Morsi???s Muslim Brotherhood urged people to rise up against the army, which they accuse of a military coup to topple the leader, threatening an escalation in Egypt???s political crisis.
At a hospital near the Rabaa Adawiya mosque where Islamists have camped out since Morsi was toppled last Wednesday, rooms were crammed with people wounded in the violence, sheets were stained with blood and medics rushed to attend to the wounded.
???They shot us with teargas, birdshot, rubber bullets ??? everything. Then they used live bullets,??? said Abdelaziz Abdel Shakua, a bearded 30-year-old who was wounded in his right...				]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
								Turkish police used water cannon to disperse protesters who tried to defy a closure order and enter an Istanbul park that was the centre of protests against Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan last month.
Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu announced the reopening of Gezi park yesterday, three weeks after riot police expelled protesters to end frequently violent protests against plans to redevelop the area. But police closed the park again hours later after protest leaders called a rally there for the evening.
The Taksim Solidarity group, combining political and non-governmental groups, opposed the construction of a replica Ottoman era barracks on the site of the park.
But after a police crackdown on a small demonstration on May 31, the protest grew into a broader action against what critics saw as Erdogan???s increasingly authoritarian style of government.
The protests rapidly mutated into nationwide demonstrations against Erdogan, accused by critics after a decade in power of ruling in an increasingly authoritarian fashion. The unrest died down in late June, but on Saturday police fired teargas and water cannon to disperse protesters who sought to march on Taksim Square and the...				]]></description>

								Syrian troops fought with rebels in Homs yesterday in a battle seen as crucial to the government???s attempts to drive a wedge between opposition-held areas and establish links between the capital and President Bashar al-Assad???s coastal strongholds.
Assad???s forces have been on the offensive in the central Syrian city for 10 days, hitting rebel-held neighbourhoods with air strikes, mortar bombs and tanks.
Rebels control much of northern Syria but have been on the back foot against Assad???s army further south since it retook Qusair last month, a town near the border with Lebanon, where victory marked a change in the government???s fortunes.
Homs, 140 kilometres north of Damascus, lies at a strategic crossing linking the capital with army bases in coastal regions controlled by Assad???s Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi???ite Islam that has dominated majority Sunni Syria since the 1960s.
Assad is trying to cement control of this belt of territory, in a move that could drive a wedge between rebel-held areas in the north and south of the country.
At a time when the army has made gains on the battlefield, Syrian state media announced that new leaders had been appointed in the ruling Baath Party...				]]></description>

								Bolivia yesterday demanded that the ambassadors from France, Spain, Portugal and Italy inform its government why they thought former US spy agency contractor Edward Snowden was on President Evo Morales??? flight from Moscow last week.
Bolivia says the four countries banned Morales???s plane from their airspace on suspicions he was transporting Snowden to Bolivia in defiance of Washington, which wants the fugitive returned home to face espionage charges.
Outraged, Bolivia is now calling the incident an act of ???state terrorism??? by the US and its allies against Morales, an outspoken critic of US policies.
???We are simply asking the government of Spain and the other governments, of course, to clarify and explain where that version of Mr Snowden being on the presidential plane came from. Who spread that fallacy, that lie????asked Communications Minister Amanda Davila.
Davila said the government believes the US knew that Snowden was not on the plane and simply wanted to intimidate Morales, who has since offered unconditional asylum to the fugitive.
???As experts in international law and human rights have said, this is a massive attack,??? she said.
???It???s the first case of state terrorism against a...				]]></description>
